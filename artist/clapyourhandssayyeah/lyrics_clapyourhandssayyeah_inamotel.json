I wish her the best\nAnd I hope she can forget me\n\nBut the ghost that comes around\nIs a dead-ringer for her\nI see her in my nightmares\nDiscussing modern literature\nWith her hands around my neck\n\nIn a motel\nWith a fashion magazine\nIn between towns\nI was thinking about my mother\nAnd I wished ill upon myself", "image": "https://images.genius.com/46f7726e76369125cf54353afb090a9f.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah"}
