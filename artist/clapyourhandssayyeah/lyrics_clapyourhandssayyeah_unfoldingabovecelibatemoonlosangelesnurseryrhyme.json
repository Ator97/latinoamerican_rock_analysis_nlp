What you want with the moon?\u201d\n\nCovered up in television interview smoke\nI could be in LA, Ma, I really don\u2019t know\nAnyway, it\u2019s somewhere there\u2019s no telling who does the selling and who gets straight bought\nLately, the stars have all been swallowed by the clouds and\nThe charlatan whispers replaced by the sound of your castaway cry\nNeither lost nor found but forever learning\nThese days I take my time (maybe too long) and shine my shoes first\nAs the wine stains me toothless, and your crying don\u2019t hurt\nThe lie that takes me home could well wrap around the earth\nAs your eyes speak of darts in the sky we through ages before\nWe through ages before\nWe through ages before\nWe through ages before", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0dc61e7a20964dec38fdfd8411b42831.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah"}
