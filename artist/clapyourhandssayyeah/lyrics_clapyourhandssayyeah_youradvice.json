Do you feel happier?\nIt was very nice\nYou ain't even gon' remember\n\nYour advice, ignore the new world\nBut it's easy for anyone to say\nLoud as I wondered, in a new kind of torture\nWhen the fight isn't bound, it just owes you a time\nTo awake it\n\nI miss the comfort of your chains\nAnd I miss the comfort of NSA\n\nAnd now the? it catches\nAs you set it in words\nThe morning bass is gold\nThe endless week-end\nThe endless week-end\nBut I'm doing alright\nWaking up so fucking slowly\n\nI miss the comfort of your chains\nAnd I miss the comfort of NSA\nAnd I miss the comfort of your advice\nIgnore the new world\nBut it's easy for anyone to say", "image": "https://images.genius.com/de0b4a565b6574cd2c627f38880bad12.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah"}
