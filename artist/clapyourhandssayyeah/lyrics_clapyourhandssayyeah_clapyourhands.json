(But I feel so lonely)\nClap your hands! (But it won't do nothing)\nClap your hands! (But I have no money)\nClap your hands! (But it don't seem likely)\nClap your hands! (Are you up to something?)\nClap your hands! (Where's my milk and honey?)\nClap your hands! (But I just look funny)\nClap your hands! (I'll just wait a while)\n\nAs time alone stands still for some\nStuffed sailor up with eyeball sun\nAnd if by castle, ship should stray\nIt has, like you, no chosen fate\nFor it's tongue-tied caboose that leads this ragged lad\nThis finger-flipping mom and dad\nFor what is worth some aimless steer\nAnd should mouth confuse my foggy mirror\nAnd reveal what is not there\nI shall take this unbound train and go away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5093829f616ec76ff4f6bf68f66663f4.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah"}
