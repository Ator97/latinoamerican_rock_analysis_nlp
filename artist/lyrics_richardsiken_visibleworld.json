You had not expected this,\nthe bedroom gone white, the astronomical light pummeling you in a stream of fists.\nYou raised your hand to your face as if\nto hide it, the pink fingers gone gold as the light\nstreamed straight to the bone,\nas if you were the small room closed in glass\nwith every speck of dust illuminated. The light is no mystery,\nthe mystery is that there is something to keep the light\nfrom passing through.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
