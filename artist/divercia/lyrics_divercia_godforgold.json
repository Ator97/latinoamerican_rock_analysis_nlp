He's on his knees!\nHe traded God for gold, and master got his soul, won't you see!\nWhile he bleeds!\n\nHe doesn't want to feel, what has become too real, he falls a sleep... in devil's arms!\nThe earth's crust opens up, the end justifies the means... God for gold!\n\nWhat you see is how they'll bleed; all for one... One for all!\n\nA pile of ash on the ground, he's gone, there is no sound...\nThis cannot be... \"We had a deal?!\"\nHe traded God for gold, now his master got his soul\nBut can't you see?! While he bleeds!\nAnother tomorrow, growing greed; lost his life for a useless dream\n\nHe doesn't want to feel, what has become too real, he falls a sleep... in devil's arms!\nWhat you see is how they'll bleed; all for one... And one for all!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7a0e3712d23c45d5ddc570bc8a788674.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Divercia"}
