Distilled through a pile of dirt\nShed a tear and let this world be drowned in its greed\n\nDeep inside the heart and through my ears the voices are whispering\nIf you don't evolve you cease to exist as an object of recreation\n\nWe slowly cease to exist as an object of recreation", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d16fd12a4c75e37c0c916185b22036de.590x584x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Divercia"}
