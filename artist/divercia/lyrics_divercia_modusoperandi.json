Like a touch of insanity\nBut what have I become? I'm just tring to set them free\nI am feeling no remorse and I could be the one you dream\nI could be anyone (Hate my only source of power)\n\nCatch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize as I live that moment again\nI visualize and internalize, realize as I read the lines that I have become that monster I was afraid\nEvery now when I hide myself, knowing that I would be found myself in the shadows of your room\nCatch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize that I have become that monster I was afraid\n\nJust a flash of humanity, some prefer punishment\nThis time I will truly set you free\n\nAnd I've been...\n\nGripped by a quiet grief. Like a touch of insanity\nBut what have I become? I'm just tring to set them free\nI am feeling no remorse and I could be the one you dream\nI could be anyone (Hate my only source of power)\n\nCatch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize as I live that moment again\nI visualize and internalize, realize as I read the lines that I have become that monster I was afraid\nEvery now when I hide myself, knowing that I would be found myself in the shadows of your room\nCatch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize that I have become that monster I was afraid", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d16fd12a4c75e37c0c916185b22036de.590x584x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Divercia"}
