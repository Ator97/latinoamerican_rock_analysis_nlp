B.\n\nIn twice five winters more and one,\nHermes again will cross the Sun;\nAgain a dusky spot appear,\nSlow-journeying o'er his splendid sphere:\nThe stars shall slide into their places,\nExhibiting the self-same faces,\nAnd in the like position fix\nAs Thursday morning, eighty-six.\nBut changing mortals hope in vain\nTheir lost position more to gain;\u2014\n\nOnce more between La Borde and me!\u2014\nAh, wish not what will never be!\nFor wandering planets have their rules,\nWell known in astronomic schools;\nBut life's swift wheels will ne'er turn back,\nWhen once they've measured o'er their track.\nEleven years,\u2014twice five and one,\u2014\nIs a long hour in Beauty's sun:\nThose years will pilfer many a grace\nWhich decks La Borde's enchanting face;\nThe little Loves which round her fly,\nWill moult the wing, and droop, and die:\nAnd I, grown dull, my lyre unstrung\nIn some old chimney corner hung,\nGay scenes of Paris all forgot,\nShall rust within my silent cot:\nLife's summer ended, and life's spring,\nNor she shall charm, nor I shall sing.\nEven Cook, upon whose blooming brow\nThe youthful graces open now,\n\nEleven years may vastly change:\nNo more the Provinces he'll range;\nNo more with humid eyes entreat,\nAnd wait his doom at Beauty's feet;\nMarried and grave, he'll spend his time\nFar from the idleness of rime;\nForgetting oranges and myrtle,\nWill drink his port and eat his turtle;\nPerhaps with country justice sit,\nAnd turn his back on thee and Wit.\n\nFor thee, my friend, whose copious vein\nPours forth at will the polished strain,\nWith every talent formed to please,\nEach fair idea quick to seize;\u2014\nWho knows within so long a space\nWhat scenes the present may efface,\nWhat course thy stream of life may take,\nWhat winds may curl, what storms may shake,\n\nWhat varying colours, gay or grave,\nShall tinge by turns the passing wave;\nOf objects on its banks what swarms\u2014\nThe loftier or the fairer forms\u2014\nShall glide before the liquid glass,\nAnd print their image as they pass?\n\nLet Fancy then and Friendship stray\nIn Pleasure's flowery walks today,\nToday improve the social hours,\nAnd build today the Muse's bowers;\nAnd when life's pageant on will go,\nTry not to stop the passing show;\nBut give to scenes that once were dear,\nA sigh, a farewell, and a tear.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
