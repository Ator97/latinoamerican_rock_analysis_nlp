where reclined, pale Beauty courts the breeze,\nDiffused on sofas of voluptuous ease;\nWith anxious awe her menial train around\nCatch her faint whispers of half-uttered sound;\nSee her, in monstrous fellowship, unite\nAt once the Scythian and the Sybarite!\nBlending repugnant vices, misallied,\nWhich frugal nature purposed to divide;\nSee her, with indolence to fierceness joined,\nOf body delicate, infirm of mind,\nWith languid tones imperious mandates urge;\nWith arm recumbent wield the household scourge;\nAnd with unruffled mien, and placid sounds,\nContriving torture, and inflicting wounds.\n\nNor, in their palmy walks and spicy groves,\nThe form benign of rural Pleasure roves;\nNo milk-maid's song, or hum of village talk,\nSoothes the lone poet in his evening walk:\nNo willing arm the flail unwearied plies,\nWhere the mixed sounds of cheerful labour rise;\nNo blooming maids and frolic swains are seen\nTo pay gay homage to their harvest queen:\nNo heart-expanding scenes their eyes must prove\nOf thriving industry and faithful love:\nBut shrieks and yells disturb the balmy air,\nDumb sullen looks of woe announce despair,\nAnd angry eyes through dusky features glare.\nFar from the sounding lash the Muses fly,\nAnd sensual riot drowns each finer joy.\n\nNor less from the gay East, on essenced wings,\nBreathing unnamed perfumes, Contagion springs;\nThe soft luxurious plague alike pervades\nThe marble palaces and rural shades;\nHence thronged Augusta builds her rosy bowers,\nAnd decks in summer wreaths her smoky towers;\nAnd hence, in summer bowers, Art's costly hand\nPours courtly splendours o'er the dazzled land:\nThe manners melt;\u2014one undistinguished blaze\nO'erwhelms the sober pomp of elder days;\nCorruption follows with gigantic stride,\nAnd scarce vouchsafes his shameless front to hide:\nThe spreading leprosy taints every part,\nInfects each limb, and sickens at the heart.\nSimplicity, most dear of rural maids,\nWeeping resigns her violated shades:\nStern Independence from his glebe retires,\nAnd anxious Freedom eyes her drooping fires;\nBy foreign wealth are British morals changed,\nAnd Afric's sons, and India's, smile avenged.\n\nFor you, whose tempered ardour long has borne\nUntired the labour, and unmoved the scorn;\nIn Virtue's fasti be inscribed your fame,\nAnd uttered yours with Howard's honoured name;\nFriends of the friendless\u2014Hail, ye generous band!\nWhose efforts yet arrest Heaven's lifted hand,\nAround whose steady brows, in union bright,\nThe civic wreath and Christian's palm unite:\nYour merit stands, no greater and no less,\nWithout, or with the varnish of success:\nBut seek no more to break a nation's fall,\nFor ye have saved yourselves\u2014and that is all.\nSucceeding times your struggles, and their fate,\nWith mingled shame and triumph shall relate;\nWhile faithful History, in her various page,\nMarking the features of this motley age,\nTo shed a glory, and to fix a stain,\nTells how you strove, and that you strove in vain.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
