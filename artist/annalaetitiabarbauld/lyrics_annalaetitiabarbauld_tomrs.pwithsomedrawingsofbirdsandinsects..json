the bright train their radiant wings unfold!\n\nWith silver fringed, and freckled o'er with gold:\n\nOn the gay bosom of some fragrant flower\n\nThey idly fluttering live their little hour;\n\nTheir life all pleasure, and their task all play,\n\nAll spring their age, and sunshine all their day.\n\nNot so the child of sorrow, wretched Man,\n\nHis course with toil concludes, with pain began;\n\nThat his high destiny he might discern,\n\nAnd in misfortune's school this lesson learn\u2026.\n\nPleasure's the portion of the inferior kind;\n\nBut glory, virtue, Heaven for Man designed.\n\nWhat atom-forms of insect life appear!\n\nAnd who can follow Nature's pencil here?\n\nTheir wings with azure, green and purple glossed,\n\nStudded with coloured eyes, with gems embossed,\n\n\nInlaid with pearl, and marked with various stains\n\nOf lively crimson through their dusky veins.\n\nSome shoot like living stars athwart the night,\n\nAnd scatter from their wings a vivid light,\n\nTo guide the Indian to his tawny loves,\n\nAs through the woods with cautious step he moves.\n\nSee the proud giant of the beetle race;\n\nWhat shining arms his polished limbs enchase!\n\nLike some stern warrior formidably bright,\n\nHis steely sides reflect a gleaming light:\n\n\nOn his large forehead spreading horns he wears,\n\nAnd high in air the branching antlers bears:\n\nO'er many an inch extends his wide domain,\n\nAnd his rich treasury swells with hoarded grain.\n\nThy friend thus strives to cheat the lonely hour,\n\nWith song or paint, an insect or a flower:-\n\nYet if Amanda praise the flowing line,\n\nAnd bend delighted o'er the gay design,\n\nI envy not nor emulate the fame\n\nOr of the painter's or the poet's name:\n\n\nCould I to both with equal claim pretend,\n\nYet far, far dearer were the name of Friend.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
