{"songs": [{"title": "On The Death of Princess Charlotte", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Yes, Britain mourns, as with electric touch,\nFor youth, for love, for happiness destroyed,\nHer universal population melts\nIn grief spontaneous, and hard hearts are moved,\nAnd rough unpolished natures learn to feel\nFor those they envied, leveled in the dust\nBy Fate's impartial stroke; and pulpits sound\nWith vanity and woe to earthly goods,\nAnd urge and dry the tear.\u2014Yet one there is\nWho midst this general burst of grief remains\nIn strange tranquillity; whom not the stir\nAnd long-drawn murmurs of the gathering crowd,\nThat by his very windows trail the pomp\nOf hearse, and blazoned arms, and long array\nOf sad funereal rites, nor the loud groans\nAnd deep-felt anguish of a husband's heart,\nCan move to mingle with this flood one tear:\nIn careless apathy, perhaps in mirth,\nHe wears the day. Yet is he near in blood,\nThe very stem on which this blossom grew,\nAnd at his knees she fondled in the charm\nAnd grace spontaneous which alone belongs\nTo untaught infancy:\u2014Yet O forbear!\nNor deem him hard of heart; for awful, struck\nBy Heaven's severest visitation, sad,\nLike a scathed oak amidst the forest trees,\nLonely he stands;\u2014leaves bud, and shoot, and fall;\nHe holds no sympathy with living nature\nOr time's incessant change. Then in this hour,\nWhile pensive thought is busy with the woes\nAnd restless change of poor humanity,\nThink then, O think of him, and breathe one prayer,\nFrom the full tide of sorrow spare one tear,\nFor him who does not weep!", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
