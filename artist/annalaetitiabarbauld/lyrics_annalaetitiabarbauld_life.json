I know not what thou art\nBut know that thou and I must part;\nAnd when, or how, or where we met\nI own to me\u2019s a secret yet\nBut this I know, when thou art fled\nWhere\u2019er they lay these limbs, this head\nNo clod so valueless shall be\nAs all that then remains of me\nO whither, whither dost thou fly\nWhere bend unseen thy trackless course\nAnd in this strange divorce\nAh tell where I must seek this compound I?\n\nTo the vast ocean of empyreal flame\nFrom whence thy essence came\nDost thou thy flight pursue, when freed\nFrom matter\u2019s base encumbering weed?\nOr dost thou, hid from sight\nWait, like some spell-bound knight\nThrough blank oblivious years th\u2019 appointed hour\nTo break thy trance and reassume thy power?\nYet canst thou without thought or feeling be?\nO say what art thou, when no more thou \u2019rt thee?\n\nLife! we\u2019ve been long together\nThrough pleasant and through cloudy weather;\n\u2019Tis hard to part when friends are dear;\nPerhaps \u2019t will cost a sigh, a tear;\nThen steal away, give little warning\nChoose thine own time;\nSay not Good night, but in some brighter clime\nBid me Good morning", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
