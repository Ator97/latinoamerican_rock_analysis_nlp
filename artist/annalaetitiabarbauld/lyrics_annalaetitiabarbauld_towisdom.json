I bless thy gentle sway,\nAnd ever, ever will obey.\n\nBut if thou com'st with frown austere\nTo nurse the brood of care and fear;\nTo bid our sweetest passions die,\nAnd leave us in their room a sigh;\n\nOf if thine aspect stern have power\nTo wither each poor transient flower,\nThat cheers the pilgrimage of woe,\nAnd dry the springs whence hope should flow;\nWISDOM, thine empire I disclaim,\nThou empty boast of pompous name!\nIn gloomy shade of cloisters dwell,\nBut never haunt my chearful cell.\nHail to pleasure's frolic train;\nHail to fancy's golden reign;\nFestive mirth, and laughter wild,\nFree and sportful as the child;\nHope with eager sparkling eyes,\nAnd easy faith, and fond surprise:\nLet these, in fairy colours drest,\nForever share my careless breast;\nThen, tho' wise I may not be,\nThe wise themselves shall envy me.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
