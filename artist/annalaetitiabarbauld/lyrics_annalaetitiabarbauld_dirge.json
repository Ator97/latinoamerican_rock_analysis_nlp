O where art thou now!\nO whisper to my soul!\nO let some soothing thought of thee,\nThe bitter grief control!\n'Tis not for thee the tears I shed,\nThy sufferings now are o'er;\nThe sea is calm, the tempest past,\nOn that eternal shore.\nNo more the storms that wrecked thy peace\nShall tear that gentle breast;\nNor Summer's rage, nor Winter's cold,\nThy poor, poor frame molest.\nThy peace is sealed, thy rest is sure,\nMy sorrows are to come;\nAwhile I weep and linger here,\nThen follow to the tomb.\nAnd is the awful veil withdrawn,\nThat shrouds from mortal eyes,\nIn deep impenetrable gloom,\nThe secrets of the skies?\nO, in some dream of visioned bliss,\nSome trance of rapture, show\nWhere, on the bosom of thy God,\nThou rest'st from human woe!\nThence may thy pure devotion's flame\nOn me, on me descend;\nTo me thy strong aspiring hopes,\nThey faith, thy fervours lend.\nLet these my lonely path illume,\nAnd teach my weakened mind\nTo welcome all that's left of good,\nTo all that's lost resigned.\nFarewell! With honour, peace, and love,\nBe thy dear memory blest!\nThou hast no tears for me to shed,\nWhen I too am at rest.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
