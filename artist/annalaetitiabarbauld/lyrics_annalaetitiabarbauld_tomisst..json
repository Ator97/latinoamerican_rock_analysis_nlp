{"songs": [{"title": "To Miss T.", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Sweet are the thoughts that stir the virgin's breast\nWhen love first enters there, a timid guest;\nBefore her dazzled eyes gay visions shine,\nAnd laughing Cupids wreaths of roses twine;\nAnd conscious beauty hastens to employ\nHer span of empire and her dream of joy.\n\nSarah! not thus to thee his power is shown;\nMore stern he greets thee from his awful throne.\nThee, called to bid thy cheering converse flow,\nAnd shed thy sweetness in the house of woe;\nThe solemn sympathies of grief to share,\nAnd, sadly smiling, soothe a sister's care.\n\nO'er her young hopes the sable pall is spread;\nHer wedded heart holds converse with the dead;\nTo ties, no longer earthly, fondly true,\nEach thought that breathes of love, must breathe of heaven too.\n\nThus, Sarah, love thy nobler mind prepares,\nShows thee his dangers, duties, sorrows, cares;\nThus with severer lessons schools thy heart,\nAnd, pleased his happiest influence to impart,\nFor thee, dismissing from his chastened train\nEach motley form of fickle, light, or vain,\nBuilds the strong fabric of that love sublime\nWhich conquers Death, and triumphs over Time.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
