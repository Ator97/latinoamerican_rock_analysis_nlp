Come then, domestic Muse,\nIn slipshod measure loosely prattling on\nOf farm or orchard, pleasant curds and cream,\nOr drowning flies, or shoe lost in the mire\nBy little whimpering boy, with rueful face;\nCome, Muse, and sing the dreaded Washing-Day.\nYe who beneath the yoke of wedlock bend,\nWith bowed soul, full well ye ken the day\nWhich week, smooth sliding after week, brings on\nToo soon;\u2014for to that day nor peace belongs\nNor comfort;\u2014ere the first gray streak of dawn,\nThe red-armed washers come and chase repose.\nNor pleasant smile, nor quaint device of mirth,\nE'er visited that day: the very cat,\nFrom the wet kitchen scared and reeking hearth,\nVisits the parlour,\u2014an unwonted guest.\nThe silent breakfast-meal is soon dispatched;\nUninterrupted, save by anxious looks\nCast at the lowering sky, if sky should lower.\nFrom that last evil, O preserve us, heavens!\nFor should the skies pour down, adieu to all\nRemains of quiet: then expect to hear\nOf sad disasters,\u2014dirt and gravel stains\nHard to efface, and loaded lines at once\nSnapped short,\u2014and linen-horse by dog thrown down,\nAnd all the petty miseries of life.\nSaints have been calm while stretched upon the rack,\nAnd Guatimozin smiled on burning coals;\nBut never yet did housewife notable\nGreet with a smile a rainy washing-day.\n\u2014But grant the welkin fair, require not thou\nWho call'st thyself perchance the master there,\nOr study swept, or nicely dusted coat,\nOr usual 'tendance;\u2014ask not, indiscreet,\nThy stockings mended, though the yawning rents\nGape wide as Erebus; nor hope to find\nSome snug recess impervious: shouldst thou try\nThe 'customed garden walks, thine eye shall rue\nThe budding fragrance of thy tender shrubs,\nMyrtle or rose, all crushed beneath the weight\nOf coarse checked apron,\u2014with impatient hand\nTwitched off when showers impend: or crossing lines\nShall mar thy musings, as the wet cold sheet\nFlaps in thy face abrupt. Woe to the friend\nWhose evil stars have urged him forth to claim\nOn such a day the hospitable rites!\nLooks, blank at best, and stinted courtesy,\nShall he receive. Vainly he feeds his hopes\nWith dinner of roast chicken, savoury pie,\nOr tart or pudding:\u2014pudding he nor tart\nThat day shall eat; nor, though the husband try,\nMending what can't be helped, to kindle mirth\nFrom cheer deficient, shall his consort's brow\nClear up propitious:\u2014the unlucky guest\nIn silence dines, and early slinks away.\nI well remember, when a child, the awe\nThis day struck into me; for then the maids,\nI scarce knew why, looked cross, and drove me from them:\nNor soft caress could I obtain, nor hope\nUsual indulgencies; jelly or creams,\nRelic of costly suppers, and set by\nFor me their petted one; or buttered toast,\nWhen butter was forbid; or thrilling tale\nOf ghost or witch, or murder\u2014so I went\nAnd sheltered me beside the parlour fire:\nThere my dear grandmother, eldest of forms,\nTended the little ones, and watched from harm,\nAnxiously fond, though oft her spectacles\nWith elfin cunning hid, and oft the pins\nDrawn from her ravelled stocking, might have soured\nOne less indulgent.\u2014\nAt intervals my mother's voice was heard,\nUrging dispatch: briskly the work went on,\nAll hands employed to wash, to rinse, to wring,\nTo fold, and starch, and clap, and iron, and plait.\nThen would I sit me down, and ponder much\nWhy washings were. Sometimes through hollow bowl\nOf pipe amused we blew, and sent aloft\nThe floating bubbles; little dreaming then\nTo see, Mongolfier, thy silken ball\nRide buoyant through the clouds\u2014so near approach\nThe sports of children and the toils of men.\nEarth, air, and sky, and ocean, hath its bubbles,\nAnd verse is one of them\u2014this most of all.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
