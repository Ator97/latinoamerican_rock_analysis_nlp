'T is now the sickness of the year,\nNot to be medicined by the skillful hand.\nPale suns arise that like weak kings behold\nTheir predecessor's empire moulder from them;\nWhile swift-increasing spreads the black domain\nOf melancholy Night;\u2014no more content\nWith equal sway, her stretching shadows gain\nOn the bright morn, and cloud the evening sky.\nFarewell the careless lingering walk at eve,\nSweet with the breath of kine and new-spread hay;\nAnd slumber on a bank, where the lulled youth,\nHis head on flowers, delicious languor feels\nCreep in the blood. A different season now\nInvites a different song. The naked trees\nAdmit the tempest; rent is Nature's robe;\nFast, fast, the blush of Summer fades away\nFrom her wan cheek, and scarce a flower remains\nTo deck her bosom; Winter follows close,\nPressing impatient on, and with rude breath\nFans her discoloured tresses. Yet not all\nOf grace and beauty from the falling year\nIs torn ungenial. Still the taper fir\nLifts its green spire, and the dark holly edged\nWith gold, and many a strong perennial plant,\nYet cheer the waste: nor does yon knot of oaks\nResign its honours to the infant blast.\nThis is the time, and these the solemn walks,\nWhen inspiration rushes o'er the soul\nSudden, as through the grove the rustling breeze.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
