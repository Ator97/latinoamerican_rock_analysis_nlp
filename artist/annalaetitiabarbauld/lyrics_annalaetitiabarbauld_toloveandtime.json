MULSO.\n\nOn Stella's brow as lately envious Time\nHis crooked lines with iron pencil traced,\nThat brow, erewhile like ivory tablets smooth,\nWith Love's high trophies hung, and victories graced,\nDigging him little caves in every cell,\nAnd every dimple, once where Love was wont to dwell;\nHe spied the God: and wondered still to spy,\nWho higher held his torch in Time's despite;\nNor seemed to care for aught that he could do.\nThen sternly thus he sought him thence to' affright:\nThe sovereign boy entrenched in a smile,\nAt his sour crabbed speech sat mocking all the while.\n\n\u201cWhat dost thou here, fond boy? Away, for shame!\nMine is this field, by conquest fairly won;\nLove cannot reap his joys where Time has ploughed,\nThou and thy light-winged troop should now begone.\nGo revel with fresh Youth in scenes of folly,\nSage Thought I bring, and Care, and pale-eyed Melancholy.\n\u201cThy streams are froze, that once so briskly ran,\nThy bough is shaken by the mellow year;\nBoreas and Zephyr dwell not in one cave,\nAnd swallows spread their wings when winter's near;\nSee where Florella's cheeks soft bloom disclose,\nGo seek the springing bud, and leave the faded rose.\u201d\nThus spake old Time, of Love the deadliest foe,\u2014\nAh me, that gentle Love such foes should meet!\nBut nothing daunted he returned again,\nTempering with looks austere his native sweet;\nAnd, \u201cFool!\u201d said he, \u201cto think I e'er shall fly\nFrom that rich palace where my choicest treasures lie.\n\n\u201cDost thou not see,\u2014or art thou blind with age,\u2014\nHow many Graces on her eyelids sit,\nLinking those viewless chains that bind the soul,\nAnd sharpening smooth discourse with pointed wit;\nHow many where she moves attendant wait,\nThe slow smooth step inspire, or high commanding gait?\n\u201cEach one a several charm around her throws,\nSome to attract, some powerful to repell,\nSome mix the honeyed speech with winning smiles,\nOr call wild Laughter from his antic cell;\nSeverer some, to strike with awful fear\nEach rude licentious tongue that wounds the virtuous ear.\n\u201cNot one of them is of thy scythe in dread,\nOr for thy cankered malice careth aught,\nThy shaking fingers never can untwist\nThe magic c\u00e6stus by their cunning wrought;\nAnd I, their knight, their bidding must obey,\nFor where the Graces are, will Love for ever stay.\n\n\u201cIn my rich fields now boast the ravage done,\nThose lesser spoils,\u2014her brow, her cheek, her hair,\nAll that the touches of decay can feel,\u2014\nTake these, she has enough besides to spare;\nI cannot thee dislodge, nor shalt thou me,\nSo thou and I, old Time, perforce must once agree.\n\u201cNor is the boasted ravage all thine own,\nNor was the field by conquest fairly gained;\nFor leagued with Sickness, Life and Nature's foe,\nThat fiend accurst thy savage wars maintained;\nHis hand the furrows sunk where thou didst plough,\nHe undermined the tree, where thou didst shake the bough.\n\u201cBut both unite, for both I here defy;\nSpoil ye have made, but have no triumphs won;\nAnd though the daffodil more freshly blooms,\nSpreading her gay leaves to the morning sun,\nYet never will I leave the faded rose,\nWhilst the pale lovely flower such sweetness still bestows.\u201d\n\nThis said, exulting Cupid clapped his wings.\nThe sullen power, who found his rage restrained,\nAnd felt the strong controul of higher charms,\nShaking his glass, vowed while the sands would run\nFor many a year the strife should be maintained:\nBut Jove decreed no force should Love destroy,\nNor time should quell the might of that immortal boy.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
