Let it be.\n\u201cOn evil days though fallen and evil tongues,\u201d\n\nTo thee, the slander of a passing age\nImports not. Scenes like these hold little space\nIn his large mind, whose ample stretch of thought\nGrasps future periods.\u2014Well canst thou afford\nTo give large credit for that debt of fame\nThy country owes thee. Calm thou canst consign it\nTo the slow payment of that distant day,\u2014\nIf distant,\u2014when thy name, to Freedom's joined,\nShall meet the thanks of a regenerate land.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
