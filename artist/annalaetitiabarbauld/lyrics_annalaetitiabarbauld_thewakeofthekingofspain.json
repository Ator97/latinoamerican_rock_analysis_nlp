O king, rejoice!\nThe bowl is filled, the feast is spread,\nCome forth, O king!\u201d\u2014The king is dead.\nThe bowl, the feast, he tastes no more,\nThe feast of life for him is o'er.\n\nAgain the sounding portals shake,\nAnd speaks again the voice that spake:\n\u2014\u201cThe sun is high, the sun is warm,\nForth to the field the gallants swarm,\nThe foaming bit the courser champs,\nHis hoof the turf impatient stamps;\nLight on their steeds the hunters spring:\nThe sun is high\u2014Come forth, O king!\u201d\n\nAlong these melancholy walls\nIn vain the voice of pleasure calls:\nThe horse may neigh, and bay the hound,\u2014\nHe hears no more; his sleep is sound.\nRetire;\u2014once more the portals close;\nLeave, leave him to his dread repose.", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
