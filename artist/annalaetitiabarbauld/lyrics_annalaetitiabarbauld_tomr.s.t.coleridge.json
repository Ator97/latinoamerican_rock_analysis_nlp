Coleridge", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Midway the hill of science, after steep\nAnd rugged paths that tire the' unpractised feet,\nA grove extends; in tangled mazes wrought,\nAnd filled with strange enchantment:\u2014dubious shapes\nFlit through dim glades, and lure the eager foot\nOf youthful ardour to eternal chase.\nDreams hang on every leaf: unearthly forms\nGlide through the gloom; and mystic visions swim\nBefore the cheated sense. Athwart the mists,\nFar into vacant space, huge shadows stretch,\nAnd seem realities; while things of life,\nObvious to sight and touch, all glowing round,\nFade to the hue of shadows\u2014Scruples here,\nWith filmy net, most like the autumnal webs\nOf floating gossamer, arrest the foot\nOf generous enterprise; and palsy hope\nAnd fair ambition with the chilling touch\nOf sickly hesitation and blank fear.\nNor seldom Indolence these lawns among\nFixes her turf-built seat; and wears the garb\nOf deep philosophy, and museful sits,\nIn dreamy twilight of the vacant mind,\nSoothed by the whispering shade; for soothing soft\nThe shades; and vistas lengthening into air,\nWith moonbeam rainbows tinted.\u2014Here each mind\nOf finer mould, acute and delicate,\nIn its high progress to eternal truth\nRests for a space, in fairy bowers entranced;\nAnd loves the softened light and tender gloom;\nAnd, pampered with most unsubstantial food,\nLooks down indignant on the grosser world,\nAnd matter's cumbrous shapings. Youth beloved\nOf Science\u2014of the Muse beloved,\u2014not here,\nNot in the maze of metaphysic lore,\nBuild thou thy place of resting! lightly tread\nThe dangerous ground, on noble aims intent;\nAnd be this Circe of the studious cell\nEnjoyed, but still subservient. Active scenes\nShall soon with healthful spirit brace thy mind;\nAnd fair exertion, for bright fame sustained,\nFor friends, for country, chase each spleen-fed fog\nThat blots the wide creation.\u2014\nNow Heaven conduct thee with a parent's love!", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Anna Laetitia Barbauld"}
