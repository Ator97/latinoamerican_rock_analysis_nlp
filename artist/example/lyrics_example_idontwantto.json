(I don't know)\nA swagger in my step like a crook, then I think\nThe girl looks shook, she's had too much to drink\nI look at her eyeballs to see if they're pink\nBut I don't get a chance cause she gives me a wink\nSo I travel to hers in an illegal cab\nPlus I know she's a student, her house is drab\nIn my head I'm laughing, [I've put the graft in?]\nStereo's playing some timeless Marvin\nThe lights dim down and the clothes come off\nBut I pass out, cause her pillow's too soft\n\n[Hook: x2]\nI don't want (No no no no)\nTo be true (No no no no)\nI don't want\nTo make love to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm up the next morning, but where the hell's this?\nI'm trapped in girly purple abyss\nIt's proving costly, she took me hostage\nFirst things first man, where's the Frosties?\nI slowly tiptoe towards the door\nBut she grabs my left arm like I've broken the law\nNow who am I kidding, I ain't her guest\nBut she playing like she got me under house arrest\nShe starts with a speech about how she's feeling\nI'm more intrigued by her lilac ceiling\nAny time now there's a question pending\nShe wants to confirm a romantic ending\nWhy do they charm you with hocus-pocus?\nI gotta get home for the Football Focus\nTo dodge small talk I admit defeat\n\"Er, how are you for dinner love? Tuesday week?\"\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAs we waited at the bus stop she wanted a cab\nBut I made her see sense with the gift of the gab\nA cab's 20 quid, and that's money for us\nPlus it's it's one nugget each on the 220 bus\nThere's one little issue that we gotta address\nI got just enough cash for a Pizza Express\nEven though she wants Thai chilli beef with mango\nI'd be content with some wings from Nando's\nWe get to Express, but before we can order\nShe starts with a tirade that I never call her\nI say \"I'm trying to keep my phone bills smaller\"\nTry and change the subject, \"Have you got taller?\"\n\"Don't give me that, that's a load of tosh\"\nShe says words like that, she's a little bit posh\n\"Look, all I want, Ell, is a call at lunches\"\nAs she keeps ranting, the waiter approaches\n\"Be honest, you want this to work or not?\"\n\"Er, doughballs, please and an American Hot\"\n\"I'm talking, geezer I want to know please\"\n\"She'll have a Caesar with no anchovies\nAnd two Peronis\" he makes a note\nI look back at her and she's getting her coat\nShe heads for the door like a spoilt adult\nMore food for me, eh? What a result\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/59069b98384c74231cf11534dfaf453c.455x455x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
