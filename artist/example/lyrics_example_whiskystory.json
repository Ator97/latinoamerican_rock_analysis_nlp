I can't recall her name\nShe lies there on the sofa every morning like Lorraine\nHer waistline gets a rub, retrace our night of fun\nThese constant slap-dash flashbacks of our date night down the pub\nI hear somebody leaving, somebody heaving, somebody barely breathing\nIt's hard to remember where it descended, started as the quietest evening\nI don't wanna live in this drama, I can't keep playing this game\nBut the Friday night delights outweigh the Sunday morning pain, let's do it again\n\n[Chorus]\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\n\n[Verse 2: Example]\nShe's still here staying over, still can't recall her name\nShe lies here on the sofa every morning like Lorraine\nWe start to feel the love, another little night of fun\nThese constant slap-dash flashbacks of our date night down the pub\nThe girl is attached so I'm heading out the back door\nPast the bloke with the smokes and the slack jaw\nSo fit, they all think she's an actor\n\"What is her name? What is her name?\"\nHop on that train, it's the weekend sagas\nShould've stopped but we've gone too far now\nDon't stop, yeah we've gone too far now\nCan't stop, yeah we've gone too far now\n\n(One more time, let's go)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\n\n(Are you ready? One more time\nEverybody in the building)\n\n[Verse 3: Example]\nYo, stepped to the bar, purchased a beverage\nIn the morning, sure of brain haemorrhage\nShot of tequila, soda, vodka\nGot a couple ladies on my radar\nUsed to be rucks down at Oceana\nThen we did pub crawls, caused palaver\nNow we stay awake tryna make hearts race\nIn the hope that we see ma\u00f1ana\n\n[Bridge]\nI can keep you satisfied, I can keep you satisfied\nI can keep you satisfied, I can keep you satisfied\n\n[Chorus]\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied\nOh darling, let's stay up all night\nDrinking whisky, telling stories, I can keep you satisfied", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/29d4a75d7be55b6fe443a273ad6dfeea.760x761x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
