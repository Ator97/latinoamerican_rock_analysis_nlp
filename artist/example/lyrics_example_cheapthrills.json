Hmm, you wanna gimme that?\nTell me, are you really that kind of girl?\nCan kinda tell, time will tell\nI came to play hard and find a girl\nYou wanna feel love like all my peoples?\nTry one of these, they're cheap thrills\n\n[Link 1]\nCheap thrills, they be nice\nYou get thrills but don't pay the price\nAnd maybe if the lady likes\nThings get bigger, like Katie Price\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nI saw Miss World on the dancefloor\nWiggling her arse for a second, what better could you ask for?\nThen I passed her\nAnd this is what I asked her\n\"What you want, sweetie? Come see me\nFor cheap thrills, what can I get thee?\"\nFreckly, speckly, lovey dovey\nSmiley faces, try me, taste this\nMitsubishi, it's a mystery\nWhy these thrills get cheaper monthly\nGet dropped more than Humpty Dumpty\nSomething tells me people love me\n\n[Link 2]\nCheap thrills, they be nice\nYou get thrills but don't pay the price\nAnd maybe if the lady likes\nGet a double six when you roll the dice", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4d9ccb012654b3880ff4d8d3eb05ea42.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
