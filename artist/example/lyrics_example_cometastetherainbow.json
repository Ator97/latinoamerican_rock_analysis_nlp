Time applied\nSomething, something, what's the rhyme?\nNever found love at the bottom of a bottle\nNo role model but I'm rolling with my models\nChosen wise, I've chosen poorly, same old story\n\n[Hook]\nI'm missing my halo\nWhere did today go?\nWhy does it rain so much when it says so?\nLet me show you all the beautiful things\nWhat do they know?\nCome taste the rainbow\nCome taste the rainbow\nCome taste the rainbow\nWhere did today go?\nWhere did today go?\n\n[Link x2]\nAlways gonna live like it's my last day\nAlways gonna live like it's my last day\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Link]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3a19f1fd21cd321c572a7e4e5317799.618x620x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
