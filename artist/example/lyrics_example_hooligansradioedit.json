X2\nWhoo hoo oo o o oo\nI don't know if you understood\n(?)\nThen drop the hoods\nEnd of the night its quite likely\nBrand new Nike are gone for good\nLose your rolex, rip your t-shirt\nBounce up 'till both your knees hurt\nJump up with your hands apart\nYou'll be going home in an ambulance\nWhere's all the hooligans\nTheir nasty music fans\nLets see you break some bits and make this pit of hooligans. X2\nWe came, we saw, we cured the crowd. X4\nI (?) the ravers with their ribs broken\nBounce up till their shins open\nBones poking through\n(?)\nWas hoping you would come to riot\n(?)\nYou ain't hurt covered in dirt\nDidn't turn up shoulda gone to work\nWhere's all the hooligans\nTheir nasty music fans\nLets see you break some bits and make this pit of hooligans. X2\nWe came, we saw, we cured the crowd. X4\nWhoo hoo oo o o oo\nWe came, we saw, we cured the crowd.
