Your show was well professional\nSay you ain't forgotten me from Nottingham, Thursday\nI'm really fucking loving you but not in a nerd way\"\n\n[Verse 2: Scroobius Pip]\nNow let me tell the tale of my very first stalker\nNot a lady but a man called Damian Walker\nI get a six foot bloke with a bad crew cut\nWhile others get hot girls that just want to\nDamian on MySpace will message me each day\nAfter a week there became very little left to say\nThen he said \"we should maybe meet up at the show\nI've gotta show you something you're gonna love, I just know\"\n\n[Hook: Example (Scroobius Pip) x2]\nShe followed me home, she followed me home\nShe's seen me once and now she'll never leave me alone\n(Don't follow me, no, don't follow me, no)\n(If I see you at a show, I'll grab my mic and I'll go)\n\n[Verse 3: Example]\nThen she pulls out her ticket stubs, shoves them in my hand\nI say \"yeah, that's wicked love, you really are a fan\"\nShe'd seen me with Hadouken!, The Rifles and The Streets\nClearly she was eager but she still seemed sweet\nShe said \"ok, Mr Gleave, can you sign my dress?\"\nBut as I went to write my name, she pulled out her breast\nI stared at her tit and then froze\nShe had a tattoo of my face with her nipple in the middle as my nose\n\n[Verse 4: Scroobius Pip]\nThat's an opening line that'll make you shiver\nThen a week later you find your corpse washed up on a river\nI didn't wanna read on but I had no choice\nSo now I read each line in a more menacing voice\nHe said \"you see, I've got your lyrics tattooed on my hip\nNow that proves, I'm the number one fan of you, Pip\nI'm gonna get some more done, but this time even bigger\nOn my neck, under the tattoo of the swastika\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 5: Example]\nHa, ok, that's a real nice picture\nI must say that I'm flattered that my head's on your tit, uh\nI didn't wanna tell her but I thought she was nast and a slut\nSaw her arms and I noticed some cuts\nShe said \"ah, don't worry, the scars have faded\nI tried to kill myself when I heard you had a lady\"\nI signed her bust, grabbed my Moby and wrote\n\"Shiner, call a bodyguard and get me a quote\"\n\n[Verse 6: Scroobius Pip]\nHe said \"I love that you're a part of the rise in white rap\nWith Mike Skinner, Example, Plan B and Just Jack\nI can understand what you say and I'm happy with that\nWe've made the genre our own, but we ain't giving it back\"\nNow was I more offended that he only liked my music cause I'm white\nOr cause he seemed to think that me and Just Jack were alike?\nI messaged back saying \"I don't really need your props, user\"\nClicked send, moved the mouse and then just clicked block user\n\n[Hook]\n\nWell to be fair, mine was quite fit actually, I probably would've banged her\n(I don't know what you're complaining about mate, mine was a massive racist, was rubbish)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8e924cb4c1fa8ff96bc56fe7ec730a69.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
