No chance\nAlways gonna be another girl on the market\n\n[Chorus/Outro]\n(Someone tell me where did the sun, someone tell me where did the sun)\n(Someone tell me where did the sun, someone tell me where did the sun go?)\nSomeone tell me where did the sun go?\nSomeone tell me where did the sun go?\nSomeone tell me where did the sun go?\nSomeone tell me where did the sun?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e286b5bd450ed19c9c57437a4d66ec9.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
