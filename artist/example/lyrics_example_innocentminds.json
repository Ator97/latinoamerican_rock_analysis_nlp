See me, I'm like \"gimme that\"\nFresh meat? See me, I'm like \"gimme that\"\nSimmer down mate, I'm the winner now\nSay what you need like a criminal, bring it down\nAsk anyone, don't ring around\nSay what you need like a criminal, bring it down\nWhen I'm in your town, on the run around\nStop chatting like that, that's not allowed\n\n[Hook x2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/014b05fb138544e53d7b1200604ba698.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
