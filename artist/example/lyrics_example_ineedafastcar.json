A proper fit lady\nFriends say I'm cool, but they never persuade me\nTry an chat her up but I ain't got skills\nAn I never do it proper. Never bought high heels\nFor a woman all I know is they like high frills\nI need cash for a new set of wheels\nThat's not possible, what about that tosser Paul?\nLeft the keys for his Porsche\nWith my dad he had only just bought her\nHere they are by our phone in the saucer\nWhat a find, I'm sure he won't mind\nIf I take his little beast on the road for a test\nDrive. To suggest that I took the piss\nIs an understatement, look I need this\nOn the road with the roof rolled back\nYou never seen a killer with a smile this hard\nBut now I'm in charge and it's cos of these keys\nHave any girl I want cos I'm the bees knees\nLook at her over there with the long hair\nShe lookin back, givin me the long stare\nA proper connoiseur *Tyres screech*\nOh Shit, I didn't see her\n\n\n[Tracy]\nYou got a fast car\nI want a ticket to anywhere\nMaybe we can make a deal\nMaybe together we can get somewhere\nAnyplace is better\nStarting from zero got nothing to lose\nMaybe we'll make something\nMe, myself, I've got nothing to prove", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19ece99275b006742584c213244cebb2.493x496x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
