Stewart]\nHey, good morning\nHey, it's calling\nHey, good morning\nWatch the sun come up\nIt's calling\nI want another day with you\n\n[Verse 1: Example]\nHow can I explain it? Scratching my brain\nHow can 10 hours feel like 10 years?\nI cry 10 men's tears as it disappears\nAlong with the passionate atmosphere\nTook your glove as a souvenir\nLeft the other on the pillow as I stroked your ear\nOne last breath of your hair, stared for a second\nThen the doorway beckoned\nSee I'm a lover not a fighter\nSo I didn't fight the fact that I more than liked ya\nDidn't matter we were under influence\nMade sense this was more than lust\nI don't own you, you don't own me\nOne night only, if only\nI could take you back and just show you off\nBut I guess if I did that, the magic is lost\n\n[Pre-Hook: Example]\nBelieve me I wanna stay\nBut I'm off and away\n\n[Hook: David A. Stewart]\nHey, good morning\nWatch the sun come up\nIt's calling\nI want another day with you\n\n[Verse 2: Example]\nYou and that red dress - what a pairing\nI kept staring, you couldn't have said less\nCan't let my head rest, thinking about ya\nReally wanna look into your catwoman eyes\nTurn back time, cause it flies by\nYou know, them Marty mcfly vibes\nSee, I can picture the bright lights\nSights and night skies and boats go by\nI don't why it happened so fast\nWhen I tried to speak your language I'm happy you laughed\nCause I'm hardly a linguist\nSpoke through kisses you didn't speak English\nAnd It was hard to distinguish\nLove at first sight or holiday romance?\nDon't care I was lost in the moment\nI really shoulda missed that flight\n\n[Pre-Hook: Example]\nBelieve me I wanna stay\nBut I'm off and away\n\n[Hook: David Stewart]\nHey, good morning\nWatch the sun come up\nIt's calling\nI want another day with you\n\n[Bridge: Example]\nI don't think I could be dreaming I felt your touch\nNo I remember you breathing when I woke up\nNow all I have are these memories I can't trust\nJust one day, won't be enough\n\n[Hook: David Stewart x2]\nHey, good morning\nWatch the sun come up\nIt's calling\nI want another day with you\n\nHey, good morning\nWatch the sun come up\nIt's calling\nI want another day with you", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/f7145178276653f0879e0775b34d122c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
