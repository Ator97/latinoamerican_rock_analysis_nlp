All the time\nSmoking\u2019s banned, no more crime\nWho needs sunshine? Things are fine\nStrangers smiling, train\u2019s on time\nWho needs sunshine? All the time\n(Everybody clap and sing and do a happy dance)\n\nAhh, morning glory, so what\u2019s the story?\nIt\u2019s pissin down again but that\u2019s hunky dory\nThough it\u2019s stormy the time has arrived for a 9 to the 5\nThat\u2019ll bore me, as much as the dude who pursued it -\nBefore me - gave it his heart\nLiterally - he got knifed in the car park\nNow he\u2019ll live forever as a figure on a bar chart\nBut that\u2019s life so enough about him\nSame old shite with the tubes on a strike\nAnd I can't pedal in cos they teefed my bike\nAgain, suppose I got myself to blame\nSee it never woulda happened if I\u2019d used two chains\nLooks of disgust on the bus from commuters\nLike I\u2019m a mutant carrying a shooter\nMove to the front then it smacks-that I\u2019m wearing\nA back-pack plus I ain't shaved for a month\n\nIf you\u2019re bored of London then you\u2019re bored of life\nLook, why the fuck you think people carry a knife?\nSee they gotta stay sharp when the humour flows\nAs I answer a phonecall a tumour grows\nWords are exchanged, now my plans have changed\nMy boy\u2019s been detained cos he caught a train -\nCoulda shown more resilience, yes he\u2019s a silly-one\nShoulda known better bein\u2019 dark and Brazilian\nHear it everyday and the shit folks say\nUK\u2019s in decay, that it\u2019s hit rock bottom\nIf it\u2019s all gone rotten get your arse to Spain\nAnd sit there and complain cos it ain't all bad:\nSo the healthcare\u2019s fucked and our schools are doomed\nBut you shouldn\u2019t just assume that the youths are thick\nKids learn new tricks from their mobile phone\nBut you moan cos they only make Kung Fu flicks\n\nStop complaining\nMoaning moaning constant whine\nJust stop complaining\nSame old shit all the time\n\nAs I look \u2018em in the eyeball it\u2019s viable they absent -\nMinded \u2013 everyone except for the blind-kid\nCos\u2019 he\u2019s the only smiling the others look unreceptive\nDefective and then I\u2019m reminded\nThat this is Londinium, home to a million\nThings that a brilliant and that\u2019s why it\u2019s silly\nThat civility and happiness are kept to a minimum\nCivilians are never satisfied\nGreedy little fucks with their eyes in the classifieds\nHere\u2019s where the matter-lies, that-aside from the fact that\nNo one is engulfed by the war in the gulf\nBut everybody sighs when some cokehead slapper-cries\nPack-of-lies from the guys at the top who monopolise\nDon\u2019t seem to care when a copper-dies\nWe\u2019re more concerned with the TV to see\nIf our favourite fat celebrity can go and drop-a-size", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e286b5bd450ed19c9c57437a4d66ec9.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
