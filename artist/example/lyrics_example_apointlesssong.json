Nah, fuck being popular\nRiddims may as well go \"blah, blah, blah\"\nI can't be creative, yo, and still be a recognised star\nNever thought it would come to this\nI'm on the textual equivalent of slitting my wrist\nIn the order of life, I'm at the bottom of the list\nAnd my ink's running out now, I won't be missed\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI admit, I wrote a pointless chat for a pointless track\nThough whatever I spit, you punks already spat\nYou got a point to prove? Well let me point to you\nAnd you can take my place and share your point of view\nYo, whatever you've got, I once had\nI used to be good, I'm now bad, a pointless person\nYo, it's so, so sad, see all my best rhymes ended up on your pad\nI'm not Jack the Lad\nAnd I'm glad, I can't be fucked to write music\nIn my world, I was given talent to lose it\nPoetical justice, you should never abuse it\nAnd never confuse it, or you're missing the point\nI approach every joint with a fresh outlook\nBut on this pointless song, it was the piss I took\nLook, if I'm saying nothing, take my CD back\nI'm sorry, I'll be creative on the follow-up track", "image": "https://images.genius.com/4e286b5bd450ed19c9c57437a4d66ec9.640x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
