If you look closely\n\nThere's something not right with her jaw\n\nShe's chewin her face like a carnivore with a piece of meat\n\nAnd furthermore\n\nRemove her glasses from her face\n\nThis females lost in space\n\nLost her sight, her eyes ain't right\n\nEyeballs painted black not white\n\nShe leans forward, whispers slowly\n\nYou'll need one of these if you want to know me\n\nI look in her hand, spot a tablet\n\nShould I just grab it or leave alone\n\nI look at her friend even she's a clone\n\nOf Ibiza's female Al Capone\n\nMust live off a heart of stone\n\nShe's far too fit, I take the bait\n\nSwallow whole the forbidden fruit\n\nMy heart starts racing, pacing\n\nThe taste is awful absolute\n\nWorld turns black and I see the truth\n\nWhatever I took weren't ecstasy\n\nI look at the dude stood next to me\n\nHe sweats too his eyes are pitch black\n\nNow I want to switch back\n\nI'm disenchanted\n\nNever take gorgeous girls for granted\n\nOne of her pills w\u00edll leave you tarnished\n\nColour those eyes with a murky varnish\n\nShe's built an army\n\nTaking trips beyond the darkness\n\nGorgeous but ruthless her\n\nFather must be Lucifer", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19ece99275b006742584c213244cebb2.493x496x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
