Why am I here?\n\nDo I have a use or am I a number?\n\nDid he make me when he made the thunder?\n\nAnd if so why?\n\nWho? When? How?\n\nAnd why should I think this now?\n\nAnd why do I need these eye \u00f1 brows?\n\nCows make milk, milk is useful\n\nWe make shit that is used to kill so\n\nWhat's the point of us being here!?\n\nHook:\nIt started off as a diamond day\n\nI saw myself in a hazy way\n\nWhat's the point of me in this world?\n\nYou can venture about the place\n\nIt seems shit stares you in the face\n\nGuess sometimes you never can tell\n\nVerse 2:\nGo to unearth the answer\n\nStrange that I've never been a chancer\n\nBut things look darker, time to scarper\n\nI don't think twice when I grab my parker\n\nAnd slam the door don't turn a shoulder\n\nI can't get old be none the wiser\n\nAnd close my eyes at night\n\nJust never knowing quite\n\nWhat the fuck we contribute to constitute\n\nThe wrongs we do and still be plain sailing\n\nTop the food chain and\n\nStill bloody complaining\n\nI set my course for Truthville\n\nThe truth-will surface maybe, (maybe)\n\nBridge:\nI left without my a to the z\n\nSo what do I say to my head\n\nI'll never find the answers I'm looking for\n\nI'm sure, I must just look unsure\n\nHook:\nIt started off as a diamond day\n\nI saw myself in a hazy way\n\nWhat's the point of me in this world?\n\nYou can venture about the place\n\nIt seems shit stares you in the face\n\nGuess sometimes you never can tell\n\nVerse 3:\nI'm strolling, (he's strolling)\n\nThe scenery is rolling\n\nI stop (he stops)\n\nWho's that talking? (Who's that talking)\n\nTo the left I see a cornfield\n\nTo the right I see some cows\n\nIn front I see a set of doors\n\nI think these things are metaphors\n\nFor what? Don't ask the question\n\nI talk to the cow for an ounce of sense then\n\nDon't look back head through the doors\n\nI'm back in my bathroom in the mirror\n\nStaring, I've solved the common mystery\n\nOf why we have a history, epiphany\n\nAnd now this piss seems bliss to me\n\nCows make milk but what's it for\n\nAnd corn tastes shit if you eat it raw\n\nBut we're so fucking clever\n\nWent and put the 2 together\n\n(Went and put the 2 together\n\nWent and put the 2 together)\n\nAnd that's the point of us in this world\n\nDouble Hook:\nIt started off as a diamond day\n\nI saw myself in a hazy way\n\nWhat's the point of me in this world?\n\nYou can venture about the place\n\nIt seems shit stares you in the face\n\nGuess sometimes you never can tell\n\nIt started off as a diamond day\n\nI saw myself in a hazy way\n\nWhat's the point of me in this world?\n\nYou can venture about the place\n\nIt seems shit stares you in the face\n\nGuess sometimes you never can tell", "image": "https://images.genius.com/19ece99275b006742584c213244cebb2.493x496x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
