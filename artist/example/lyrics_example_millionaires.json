Speechless\nCareful with my words there's no way i can cheat this\nLost them again oh someone gimme a pen\nI need to write these lessons down and maybe give em' to friends\n\n[Hook: Example & Jamie Scott]\n\nI can't promise that i won't be a fool again\nBut i never had cruel intentions\nPut me in detention as long as you want\nThen you'll see....\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Scott]\n\nThere's a million words but its never enough\nI say I love you and I'm sorry but still I get stuck\nIf I had a coin for every time we could be millionaires\nBut you don't need the diamonds\nCause I got a million ways to show you that I care\n\n[Verse 2: Example]\n\nShe isn't in it for the cash flow the girls independent\nShe don't expect pendants or remnants or necklaces\nShe only wants to trust me and don't wanna fuss me\nBut all of this depends on whether i behave recklessly\nI never meant to lie to her the truth wouldn't hurt\nBut i just dig myself into a hole and she goes berserk\nLost it again, who'd have thought that us men\nWould break down when we fell and behave like we're ten\n\n[Hook: Example & Jamie Scott]\n\nI can't promise that i won't be a fool again\nBut i never had cruel intentions\nPut me in detention as long as you want\nThen you'll see....\n\n[Chorus: Jamie Scott]\n\nThere's a million words but its never enough\nI say I love you and I'm sorry but still I get stuck\nIf I had a coin for every time we could be millionaires\nBut you don't need the diamonds\nCause I got a million ways to show you that I care\n\n[Verse 3: Example]\n\nI should be raising the bar high avoiding the bar low\nI write a million songs for you as if i was Barlow\nCause you my Bridget bar dough, my precious cargo\nI try to speak my mind but i don't get very far though\nSay something inappropriate and look like a fool\nIn my head it sounded funny but your face says it all\nI probably lose you again for a day maybe ten\nWe're broken for a minute doesn't mean its the end\n\n[Chorus X2]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/1ec6672fa52d1d6a7f310dba323f78dd.467x467x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
