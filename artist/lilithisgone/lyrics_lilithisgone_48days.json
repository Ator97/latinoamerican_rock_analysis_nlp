Knowing the options you still circle all this\nI\u2019ve failed to see the beauty in between the lines provide for me\nI ignored the signs to leave\nI\u2019ve tried to ease the struggles mentally\nBut end up hiding all the signs again until it leaves\n\n[Chorus: Lilith Is Gone & Shae Delea]\nHow can I love myself again?\nI ask the same thing every night\nHow can I love myself again?\nI asked again just hoping I could obtain an answer, please\n\n[Verse 2: Lilith Is Gone & Shae Delea]\nCan something help me see how I can live a stable life without this\nWill to leave?\nIt\u2019s a hopeless dream buried underneath the line of problems that are carried through the cracks and seams\n\n[Chorus: Lilith Is Gone & Shae Delea]\nHow can I love myself again?\nI ask the same thing every night\nHow can I love myself again?\nI asked again just hoping I could obtain an answer, please\n\n[Verse 3: Lilith Is Gone & Shae Delea]\nCan you just let me sleep?\nA sinking ship without relent while I suppress these things\nThis disbelief prevents a state of grief that wastes away my time to break the lines that stain my streets\nFake lights say our lives won\u2019t be forgotten the moment we've fallen\nWhy waste our time? Knowing the options you still circle all this\n\n[Outro: Lilith Is Gone & Shae Delea]\nHow can I love myself again?\nI ask the same thing every night\nHow can I love myself again?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f03cc83ff4baf945afa0f50038a7df41.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Lilith is gone"}
