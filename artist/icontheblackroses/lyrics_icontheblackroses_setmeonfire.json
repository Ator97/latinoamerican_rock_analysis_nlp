I turn I see your face...\n\nAnd everywhere I go... I fear you\nAnd everytime I run, I see your face... with despair...\n\nYou break my heart\nAnd set me on fire\nLouder that love\n\nI speed the pace... still you're one foot from my back\nYou still my breath as I reach out for a grasp\nYou've got me cornored... there's nowhere to escape\n\nAnd everywhere I go... I fear you\nAnd everytime I run, I see your face... with despair...\n\nYou break my heart\nAnd set me on fire\nLouder that love\n\nYou drive me like your car to your paradise\nCan't face this hell you're alone\nYou drive me in the highway to your heart\nI won't stay here you're alone and still no matter what you say\nNo matter what you say, you're alone\n\nYou break my heart\nAnd set me on fire\nLouder that love", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Icon & The Black Roses"}
