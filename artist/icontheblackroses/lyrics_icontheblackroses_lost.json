{"songs": [{"title": "Lost", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "Shattered by rain\nShrouded by thoughts on a runaway train\nSeeking shelter from the storm and from the pain\nAnother empty glass\nAnother line, another friend\nYet no sight or track\nYou can't find your way back\nAnd your flame grows colder\nAs the night is over\nNow you're lost\nFor following your heart\nIt guided you so far\nAnd you don't know where you are\nCause, baby, now you're lost\nYou were following your heart\nIt guided you so far\nAnd you don't know where you are\nCause, baby, you're lost\nHolding you head up high\nBut the mirror can't lie\nIt shows tears in your eyes\nSadness blurs your sight\nLike ether numbs your mind\nIf I only knew\nWhat you'd get yourself into...\nI wish I could\nWish I was able to save you\nAnd your flame grows colder\nAs the night is over\nNow you're lost\nFor following your heart\nIt guided you so far\nAnd you don't know where you are\nCause, baby, now you're lost\nYou were following your heart\nIt guided you so far\nAnd you don't know where you are\nCause, baby, you're lost\nOpen the door to a dream\nRan the playground\nFound a maze\nYou dared to enter\nTook a deep breath\nWe were friends holding hands\nWalk deeper into the green\nIgnore the colors as they fade\nThe world grows larger as you shrink\nYou turn around and no one's there\nBaby, now you're lost\nYou were following your heart\nIt guided you so far\nAnd you don't know where you are\nCause, baby, you're lost\nYou were following your heart\nIt guided you so far\nAnd you don't know where you are\nCause, baby, you're lost", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Icon & The Black Roses"}
