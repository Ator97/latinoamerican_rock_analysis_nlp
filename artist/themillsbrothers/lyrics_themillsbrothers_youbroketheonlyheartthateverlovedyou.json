Toot!, they never came back\n\nOh, across the alley from the Alamo\nWhen the summer sun decides to settle low\nA fly sings an Indian \"Hi-de-ho\"\nTo the people passing by\n\nAcross the alley from the Alamo\nLived a pinto pony and a Navajo\nWho used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough\nFor the people passing by\n\nThey thought that they would make some easy bucks\nBy washin' their frijoles in Duz and Lux\nA pair of very conscientious clucks\nTo the people passin' by\n\nThen they took this cheap vacation, their shoes were polished bright\nNo, they never heard the whistle, Toot! Toot! they're clear out of sight\n\nOh, across the alley from the Alamo\nWhen the starlight beams its tender glow\nThe beams go to sleep and then there ain't no dough\nFor the people passin' by\n\nOne day, they went a walkin' along the railroad track\nThey were swishin' not a-lookin' Toot! Toot!, they never came back\n\nOh, across the alley from the Alamo\nWhen the summer sun decides to settle low\nA fly sings an Indian \"Hi-de-ho\"\nTo the people passin' by\n\nAcross the alley from the Alamo", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
