It's the W.P.A\n\nThe W.P.A\nThe W.P.A\n\nSleep while you work, while you rest, while you play\nLean on your shovel to pass the time away\nT'ain't what you do; you can't die for your pay\n\nThe W.P.A\nThe W.P.A\nThe W.P.A\n\nNow don't be a fool; working hard is passe\nYou'll stand from five to six hours a day\nSit down and joke while you smoke; it's okay\n\nThe W.P.A\n\nI'm so tired, I don't know what to do\nCan't get fired, so I'll take my rest until my work\nIs through\n\nThe W.P.A\nThe W.P.A\n\nDon't mind the boss if he's cross when you're gay\nHe'll get a pink slip next month anyway\nThree little letters that make life okay\n\nThe W.P.A", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
