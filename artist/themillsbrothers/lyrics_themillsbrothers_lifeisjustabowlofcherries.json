Where are we going?\nIt's time that we found out\nWe're not here to stay\nWe're on a short holiday\n\nLife is just a bowl of cherries\nDon't take it serious, it's too mysterious\nYou work, you save, you worry so\nBut you can't take your dough\nWhen you go, go, go\n\nSo keep repeating it's the berries\nThe strongest oak must fall\nThe sweet things in life\nTo you were just loaned\n\nSo how can you lose\nWhat you've never owned?\nLife is just a bowl of cherries\nSo live and laugh at it all\n\nLife is just a bowl of cherries\nDon't take it serious, it's too mysterious\nAt eight each morning I have got a date\nTo take my plunge 'round the Empire State\n\nYou'll admit it's not the berries\nIn a building that's so tall\nThere's a guy in the show\nThe girls love to kiss\n\nGet thousands a week\nJust for crooning like this\nLife is just a bowl of, aw, nuts\nSo live and laugh at it all", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
