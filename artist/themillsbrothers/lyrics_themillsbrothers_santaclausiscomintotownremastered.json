You better watch out, you better not cry\nBetter not pout, I'm telling you why\nSanta Claus is comin' to town\n\nWith little tin horns and little toy drums\nRooty toot toots and rummy tum tums\nSanta Claus is comin' to town\nAnd curly head dolls that toddle and coo\nElephants, boats, and kiddie cars too\nSanta Claus is comin' to town\nThen kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee\nThey're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree\nSo! You better watch out, you better not cry\nBetter not pout, I'm telling you why\nSanta Claus is comin' to town\n\nNow Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play\nHe's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day\nYou'd better write your letter now\nAnd mail it right away\nBecause he's getting ready\nHis reindeer's and his sleigh. So\n\n[Chorus]\nWith little tin horns and little toy drums\nRooty toot toots and rummy tum tums\nSanta Claus is comin' to town\nAnd curly head dolls that toddle and coo\nElephants, boats, and kiddie cars too\nSanta Claus is comin' to town\nThen kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee\nThey're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree\nSo! You better watch out, you better not cry\nBetter not pout, I'm telling you why\nSanta Claus is comin' to town", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
