The smoke rings I blow each night\nOh what do they do those circles of blue and white?\nWhy do they seem to picture a dream of ______\nWhy do they fade that phantom parade of love\n\nPuff puff puff puff your cares away\nPuff puff puff Night and day\nBlow blow them into air silky little rings\nBlow blow them everywhere give your troubles wings\n\nOh little smoke rings I love\nPlease take me above\nTake me with you", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/33da74ead45fec00553dc5300fb88205.550x434x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
