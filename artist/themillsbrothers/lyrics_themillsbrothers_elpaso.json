It really is only half a verse.)\nI saddled up and away I did go\nRiding alone in the dark\nMaybe tomorrow a bullet may find me\nTonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart\nAnd as last here\n\nI am on the hill overlooking El Paso\nI can see Rose's Cantina below\nMy love is strong and it pushes me onward\nDown off the hill to Felina I go\n\nOff to my right I see five mounted cowboys\nOff to my left ride a dozen or more\nShouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me\nI've got to make it to Rose's back door\n\nSomething is dreadfully wrong for I feel\nA deep burning pain in my side\nIt's getting harder to stay in the saddle\nI'm getting weary, unable to ride\nBut my love for\n\nFelina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;\nThough I am weary, I can't stop to rest\nI see the white puff of smoke from the rifle\nI feel the bullet go deep in my chest\n\nFrom out of nowhere, Felina has found me\nKissing my cheek as she kneels by my side\nCradled by two loving arms that I'll die for\nOne little kiss and Felina goodbye", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
