Holy night!\nAll's asleep, one sole light\nJust the faithful and holy pair\nLovely boy-child with curly hair\nSleep in heavenly peace!\n\nSilent night! Holy night!\nGod's Son laughs, o how bright\nLove from your holy lips shines clear\nAs the dawn of salvation draws near\nJesus, Lord, with your birth!\n\nSilent night! Holy night!\nBrought the world peace tonight\nFrom the heavens' golden height\nShows the grace of His holy might\nJesus, as man on this earth!\n\nSilent night! holy night!\nWhere today all the might\nOf His fatherly love us graced\nAnd then Jesus, as brother embraced\nAll the peoples on earth!\n\nSilent night! Holy night!\nLong we hoped that He might\nAs our Lord, free us of wrath\nSince times of our fathers He hath\nPromised to spare all mankind!\n\nSilent night! Holy night!\nSheperds first see the sight\nTold by angelic Alleluja\nSounding everywhere, both near and far:\n\"Christ the Savior is here!\"", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
