Yellow bird, up high in banana tree\nYellow bird, you sit all alone like me\nDid your lady friend leave your nest again?\nThat is very sad, makes me feel so bad\nYou can fly away, in the sky away\nYou're more lucky than me\n\nPd... I also had a pretty girl\nShe's not with me today\nThey're all de same, the pretty girls\nTake tenderness, then they fly away\n\nPd... Yellow bird, up high in banana tree\nYellow bird, you sit all alone like me\nLet her fly away, in the sky away\nPick a town and, soon, pick from night to noon\nBlack and yellow, you like banana too\nThey might pick you someday\n\nPd... Wish that I were a yellow bird\nI'd fly away with you\nBut I am not a yellow bird\nSo here I sit, nothin' else to do\n\nPd... Yellow bird\nYellow bird\nYellow bird\n(FADE)\nYellow bird ...Pd\n...Pd...", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "The Mills Brothers"}
