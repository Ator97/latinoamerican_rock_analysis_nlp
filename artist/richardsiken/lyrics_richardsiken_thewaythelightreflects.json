I am faithful\nto you, darling. I say it to the paint. The bird floats\nin the unfinished sky with nothing to hold it.\nThe man stands, the day shines. His insides and\nhis outsides kept apart with an imaginary line\u2014\nthick and rude and imaginary because there is\nno separation, fallacy of the local body, paint\non paint. I have my body and you have yours.\nBelieve it if you can. Negative space is silly.\nWhen you bang on the wall you have to remember\nyou\u2019re on both sides of it already but go ahead,\nyell at yourself. Some people don\u2019t understand\nanything. They see the man but not the light,\nthey see the field but not the varnish. There is no\nlight in the paint, so how can you argue with them?\nThey are probably right anyway. I paint in his face\nand I paint it out again. There is a question\nI am afraid to ask: to supply the world with what?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b3f834173eb5f28f99b9027877836166.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
