{"songs": [{"title": "Driving, Not Washing", "album": "crush", "year": null, "lyrics": "It starts with bloodshed, always bloodshed, always the same\nrunning from something larger than yourself story,\nshoving money into the jaws of a suitcase, cutting your hair with a steak knife at a rest stop,\nand you're off, you\u2019re on the run, a fugitive driving away from\nsomething shameful and half-remembered.\nThey're hurling their bodies down the freeway\nto the smell of gasoline,\nwhich is the sound of a voice saying I told you so.\nYes, you did dear.\nEvery story has its chapter in the desert, the long slide from kingdom to kingdom through the wilderness,\nwhere you learn things, where you're left to your own devices. Henry\u2019s driving,\nand Theodore's bleeding shotgun into the upholstery. It's a road movie,\na double-feature, two boys striking out across America, while desire, like a monster, crawls up out of the lake\nwith all of us watching, with all of us wondering if these two boys will find a way to figure it out.\nHere is the black box, the shut eye, the bullet pearling in his living skin. This boy, half-destroyed,\nscreaming Drive into that tree, drive off the embankment.\nHenry, make something happen.\nBut angels are pouring out of the farmland, angels are swarming over the grassland,\nAngels rising from their little dens, arms swinging, wings aflutter, dropping their white-hot bombs of love.\nWe are not dirty, he keeps saying. We are not dirty... They want you to love the whole damn world but you won't,\nyou want it all narrowed down to one fleshy man in the bath,\nwho knows what to do with his body, with his hands.\nIt should follow,\nyou know this, like the panels of a comic strip,\nwe should be belted in, but you still can't get beyond your skin, and they're trying to drive you into the ground, to see if anything\nwalks away.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
