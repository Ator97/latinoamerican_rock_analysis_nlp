I owe you everything.\nYou don\u2019t, I say, you don\u2019t owe me squat, let\u2019s just get going, let\u2019s just\nget gone, but he\u2019s relentless,\nkeeps saying I owe you, says Your shoes are filling with your own damn blood, you must want something, just tell me, and it\u2019s yours.\nBut I can\u2019t look at him, can hardly speak,\nI took the bullet for all the wrong reasons, I\u2019d just as soon kill you myself, I say. You keep saying I owe you, I owe... but you say the same thing\nevery time. Let\u2019s not talk about it, let\u2019s just not talk.\nNot because I don\u2019t believe it, not because I want it any different, but I\u2019m always saving and you\u2019re always owing and I\u2019m tired of asking to settle\nthe debt. Don\u2019t bother. You never mean it\nanyway, not really, and it only makes me that much more ashamed. There\u2019s only one thing I want, don\u2019t make me say it, just get me bandages,\nI\u2019m bleeding, I\u2019m not just making conversation.\nThere\u2019s smashed glass glittering everywhere like stars. It\u2019s a Western, Henry. It\u2019s a downright shoot-em-up. We\u2019ve made a graveyard\nout of the bone white afternoon.\nIt\u2019s another wrong-man-dies scenario and we keep doing it, Henry,\nkeep saying until we get it right... but we always win and we never quit.\nSee, we\u2019ve won again,\nhere we are at the place where I get to beg for it where I get to say Please, for just one night, will you lay down next to me, we can leave our clothes on,\nwe can stay all buttoned up?\nBut we both know how it goes\u2013\u2013 I say I want you inside me and you hold my head underwater, I say I want you inside me and you split me open\nwith a knife.\nI\u2019m battling monsters, I\u2019m pulling you out of the burning buildings and you say I\u2019ll give you anything but you never come through.\nEven when you\u2019re standing up\nyou look like you\u2019re lying down, but will you let me kiss your neck, baby? Do I have to tie your arms down? Do I have to stick my tongue in your\nmouth like the hand of a thief,\nlike a burglary, like it\u2019s just another petty theft? It makes me tired, Henry. Do you see what I mean? Do you see what I\u2019m getting at?\nI swear, I end up\nfeeling empty, like you\u2019ve taken something out of me, and I have to search my body for the scars, thinking Did he find that one last tender place to\nsink his teeth in?\nI know you want me to say it, Henry, it\u2019s in the script, you want me to say\nLie down on the bed, you\u2019re all I ever wanted and worth dying for too...but I think I\u2019d rather keep the bullet.\nIt\u2019s mine, see, I\u2019m not giving it up. This way you still owe me, and that\u2019s as good as anything. You can\u2019t get out of this one, Henry, you can\u2019t get it\nout of me, and with this bullet lodged in my chest,\ncovered with your name, I will turn myself into a gun, because I\u2019m hungry and hollow and just want something to call my own. I\u2019ll be your\nslaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue\nand final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me like the bullet was already there, like it\u2019s been waiting inside me the whole time.\nDo you want it? Do you want anything I have?\nWill you throw me to the ground like you mean it, reach inside and wrestle it out with your bare hands? If you love me, Henry, you don\u2019t love me\nin a way I understand.\nDo you know how it ends? Do you feel lucky? Do you want to go home now? There\u2019s a bottle of whiskey in the trunk of the Chevy and a\ndead man at our feet\nstaring up at us like we\u2019re something interesting. This is where the evening splits in half, Henry, love or death. Grab an end, pull hard,\nand make a wish.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
