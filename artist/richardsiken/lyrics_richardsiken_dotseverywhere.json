I tell you these\nthings because I love you. Some people paint\nwith whiskey and call it social drinking. Some people\npaint drunk and put dots of color everywhere.\nIn the morning the dots make them happy. I am\nputting dots of color everywhere and you are sleeping.\nSomething has happened in the paint tonight and\nit is worth keeping. It\u2019s nothing like I thought it\nwould be and closer to what I meant. None of it is\nreal, darling. I say it to you. Maybe we will wake up\nsinging. Maybe we will wake up to the silence\nof shoes at the foot of the bed not going anywhere.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b3f834173eb5f28f99b9027877836166.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
