{"songs": [{"title": "Meanwhile", "album": "crush", "year": null, "lyrics": "Driving, dogs barking, how you get used to it, how you make the new street yours.\nTrees outside the window and a big band sound that makes you feel like everything's okay,\na feeling that lasts for one song maybe,\nthe parentheses all clicking shut behind you.\nThe way we move through time and space, or only time. The way it's night for many miles, and then suddenly\nit's not, it's breakfast and you're standing in the shower for over an hour,\nholding the bar of soap up to the light. I will keep watch. I will water the yard.\nKnot the tie and go to work. Unknot the tie and go to sleep.\nI sleep. I dream. I make up things\nthat I would never say. I say them very quietly.\nThe trees in wind, the streetlights on,\nthe click and flash of cigarettes\nbeing smoked on the lawn, and just a little kiss before we say goodnight.\nIt spins like a wheel inside you: green yellow, green blue,\ngreen beautiful green.\nIt's simple: it isn't over, it's just begun. It's green. It's still green.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
