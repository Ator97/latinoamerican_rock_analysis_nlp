You look great.\nIn a word, in a phrase, it's a movie,\nyou're the star.\nso smile for the camera, it's your big scene, you know your lines.\nI'm the director. I'm in a helicopter. I have a megaphone and you play along,\nbecause you want to die for love, you always have.\nImagine this:\nYou're pulling the car over. Somebody's waiting.\nYou're going to die\nin your best friend's arms.\nAnd you play along because it's funny, because it's written down, you've memorized it,\nit's all you know.\nI say the phrases that keep it all going,\nand everybody plays along.\nImagine:\nSomeone's pulling a gun, and you're jumping into the middle of it.\nYou didn't think you'd feel this way. There's a gun in your hand.\nIt feels hot. It feels oily.\nI'm the director and i'm screaming at you,\nI'm waving my arms in the sky,\nand everyone's watching, everyone's\ncurious, everyone's holding their breath.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
