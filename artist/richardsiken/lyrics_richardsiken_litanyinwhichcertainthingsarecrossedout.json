{"songs": [{"title": "Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out", "album": "crush", "year": null, "lyrics": "Every morning the maple leaves.\nEvery morning another chapter where the hero shifts\nfrom one foot to the other. Every morning the same big\nand little words all spelling out desire, all spelling out\nYou will be alone always and then you will die.\n\nSo maybe I wanted to give you something more than a catalog\nof non-definitive acts,\nsomething other than the desperation.\nDear So-and-So, I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t come to your party.\nDear So-and-So, I\u2019m sorry I came to your party\nand seduced you\nand left you bruised and ruined, you poor sad thing.\n\nYou want a better story. Who wouldn\u2019t?\nA forest, then. Beautiful trees. And a lady singing.\nLove on the water, love underwater, love, love and so on.\nWhat a sweet lady. Sing lady, sing! Of course, she wakes the dragon.\nLove always wakes the dragon and suddenly\nflames everywhere.\n\nI can tell already you think I\u2019m the dragon,\nthat would be so like me, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not the dragon.\nI\u2019m not the princess either.\nWho am I? I\u2019m just a writer. I write things down.\nI walk through your dreams and invent the future. Sure,\nI sink the boat of love, but that comes later. And yes, I swallow\nglass, but that comes later.\nAnd the part where I push you\nflush against the wall and every part of your body rubs against the bricks,\nshut up\nI\u2019m getting to it.\n\nFor a while I thought I was the dragon.\nI guess I can tell you that now. And, for a while, I thought I was\nthe princess,\ncotton candy pink, sitting there in my room, in the tower of the castle,\nyoung and beautiful and in love and waiting for you with\nconfidence\nbut the princess looks into her mirror and only sees the princess,\nwhile I\u2019m out here, slogging through the mud, breathing fire,\nand getting stabbed to death.\n\nOkay, so I\u2019m the dragon. Big deal.\nYou still get to be the hero.\nYou get magic gloves! A fish that talks! You get eyes like flashlights!\nWhat more do you want?\nI make you pancakes, I take you hunting, I talk to you as if you\u2019re\nreally there.\nAre you there, sweetheart? Do you know me? Is this microphone live?\n\nLet me do it right for once,\nfor the record, let me make a thing of cream and stars that becomes,\nyou know the story, simply heaven.\nInside your head you hear a phone ringing\nand when you open your eyes\nonly a clearing with deer in it. Hello deer.\n\nInside your head the sound of glass,\na car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion.\nHello darling, sorry about that.\nSorry about the bony elbows, sorry we\nlived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell\nand how I ruined everything by saying it out loud.\nEspecially that, but I should have known.\nYou see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together\nto make a creature that will do what I say\nor love me back.\nI\u2019m not really sure why I do it, but in this version you are not\nfeeding yourself to a bad man\nagainst a black sky prickled with small lights.\n\nI take it back.\nThe wooden halls like caskets. These terms from the lower depths.\nI take them back.\nHere is the repeated image of the lover destroyed.\nCrossed out.\nClumsy hands in a dark room. Crossed out. There is something\nunderneath the floorboards.\nCrossed out. And here is the tabernacle\nreconstructed.\nHere is the part where everyone was happy all the time and we were all\nforgiven,\neven though we didn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nInside your head you hear\na phone ringing, and when you open your eyes you\u2019re washing up\nin a stranger\u2019s bathroom,\nstanding by the window in a yellow towel, only twenty minutes away\nfrom the dirtiest thing you know.\nAll the rooms of the castle except this one, says someone, and suddenly\ndarkness,\nsuddenly only darkness.\n\nIn the living room, in the broken yard,\nin the back of the car as the lights go by. In the airport\nbathroom\u2019s gurgle and flush, bathed in a pharmacy of\nunnatural light,\nmy hands looking weird, my face weird, my feet too far away.\nAnd then the airplane, the window seat over the wing with a view\nof the wing and a little foil bag of peanuts.\nI arrived in the city and you met me at the station,\nsmiling in a way\nthat made me frightened. Down the alley, around the arcade,\nup the stairs of the building\nto the little room with the broken faucets, your drawings, all your things,\nI looked out the window and said\nThis doesn\u2019t look that much different from home,\nbecause it didn\u2019t,\nbut then I noticed the black sky and all those lights.\nWe walked through the house to the elevated train.\nAll these buildings, all that glass and the shiny beautiful\nmechanical wind.\nWe were inside the train car when I started to cry. You were crying too,\nsmiling and crying in a way that made me\neven more hysterical. You said I could have anything I wanted, but I\njust couldn\u2019t say it out loud.\n\nActually, you said Love, for you,\nis larger than the usual romantic love. It\u2019s like a religion. It\u2019s\nterrifying. No one\nwill ever want to sleep with you.\nOkay, if you\u2019re so great, you do it\u2014\nhere\u2019s the pencil, make it work . . .\nIf the window is on your right, you are in your own bed. If the window\nis over your heart, and it is painted shut, then we are breathing\nriver water.\nBuild me a city and call it Jerusalem. Build me another and call it\nJerusalem.\nWe have come back from Jerusalem where we found not\nwhat we sought, so do it over, give me another version,\na different room, another hallway, the kitchen painted over\nand over,\nanother bowl of soup.\nThe entire history of human desire takes about seventy minutes to tell.\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have that kind of time.\n\nForget the dragon,\nleave the gun on the table, this has nothing to do with happiness.\nLet\u2019s jump ahead to the moment of epiphany,\nin gold light, as the camera pans to where\nthe action is,\nlakeside and backlit, and it all falls into frame, close enough to see\nthe blue rings of my eyes as I say\nsomething ugly.\nI never liked that ending either. More love streaming out the wrong way,\nand I don\u2019t want to be the kind that says the wrong way.\nBut it doesn\u2019t work, these erasures, this constant refolding of the pleats.\nThere were some nice parts, sure,\nall lemondrop and mellonball, laughing in silk pajamas\nand the grains of sugar\non the toast, love love or whatever, take a number. I\u2019m sorry\nit\u2019s such a lousy story.\n\nDear Forgiveness, you know that recently\nwe have had our difficulties and there are many things\nI want to ask you.\nI tried that one time, high school, second lunch, and then again,\nyears later, in the chlorinated pool.\nI am still talking to you about help. I still do not have\nthese luxuries.\nI have told you where I\u2019m coming from, so put it together.\nWe clutch our bellies and roll on the floor . . .\nWhen I say this, it should mean laughter,\nnot poison.\n\nI want more applesauce. I want more seats reserved for heroes.\nDear Forgiveness, I saved a plate for you.\nQuit milling around the yard and come inside.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
