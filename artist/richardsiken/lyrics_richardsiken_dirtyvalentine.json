{"songs": [{"title": "Dirty Valentine", "album": "crush", "year": null, "lyrics": "There are so many things I'm not allowed to tell you.\n\nI touch myself, I dream.\n\nWearing your clothes or standing in the shower for over an hour, pretending\n\nthat this skin is your skin, these hands your hands,\n\nthese shins, these soapy flanks.\n\nThe musicians start the overture while I hide behind the microphone,\n\ntrying to match the dubbing\n\nto the big lips shining down from the screen.\n\nWe're filming the movie called Planet of Love-\n\nthere's sex of course, and ballroom dancing,\n\nfancy clothes and waterlilies in the pond, and half the night you're\n\na dependable chap, mounting the stairs in lamplight to the bath, but then\n\nthe too white teeth all night,\n\nall over the American sky, too much to bear, this constant fingering,\n\nyour hands a river gesture, the birds in flight, the birds still singing\n\noutside the greasy window, in the trees.\n\nThere's a part in the movie\n\nwhere you can see right through the acting,\n\nwhere you can tell that I'm about to burst into tears,\n\nright before I burst into tears\n\nand flee to the slimy moonlit riverbed\n\ncanopied with devastated clouds.\n\nWe're shooting the scene where I swallow your heart and you make me\n\nspit it up again. I swallow your heart and it crawls\n\nright out of my mouth.\n\nYou swallow my heart and flee, but I want it back now, baby. I want it back.\n\nLying on the sofa with my eyes closed, I didn't want to see it this way,\n\neverything eating everything in the end.\n\nWe know how the light works,\n\nwe know where the sound is coming from.\n\nVerse. Chorus. Verse.\n\nI'm sorry. We know how it works. The world is no longer mysterious.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
