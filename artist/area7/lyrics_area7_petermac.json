You silly little beggar\nSo you fall prey, during most of the day\nTo the sting of the ultra-violet ray\n\nKnock, knock, knock - here comes Mr. Cancer\nIt's all because you've been a nudie prancer\nIt's all your fault, you've invited him over\n...big and hairy, melanoma\n\nWhen your skin's peeling back\nFrom your face and your back - it's Peter Mac\n...and when the moles on your feet\nSeem to constantly bleed - it's Peter Mac\n\nBe very careful when you're down at the beach\nWhere ultra violet is the nature of the beast\nAs you turn brown, you may think you're a hunk\nBut cancer is removed in very large chunks", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Area-7"}
