{"songs": [{"title": "Falling Down", "album": "Torn Apart", "year": null, "lyrics": "... He came out of nowhere\nHe took the world by storm\nYou crowned him 'King' & worshiped him\nLike you've never done before\nHe started out a hero\nSoon became a god\nBut even those who worshiped him\nThey never heard\nThey never heard him shout\n\n... Falling down, I'm falling down!\nThe world has turned its back on me?\n... & I'm falling, I'm falling down!\n\n... They said that he had everything\nThey said he had it all\nNothing would ever hold him back\nAnd he would never take a fall\nSoon the rumours started\nThe cracks began to show\nHe'd hit his peak & left himself\nWith nowhere else\nNowhere else to go\n\n... Falling down, I'm falling down!\nThe world has turned its back on me?\n... & I'm falling, I'm falling down!\n\n... And as his empire fell apart\nHe quickly lost control\nHe lost his grip on everything\nHis lifestyle took its toll\nFriends became his enemies, he shut everybody out\nHis fall from grace was killing him\nAll he could do, all he could do was shout!\n\n... Falling down, I'm falling down!\nThe world has turned its back on me?\n... & I'm falling, I'm falling...\n... Falling down, I'm falling down!\nThe world has turned its back on me?\n... & I'm falling, I'm falling down!", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Area-7"}
