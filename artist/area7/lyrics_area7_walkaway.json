Do you just stare?\nWhen you're walking in the streets today\nWill you just simply walk away?\n\nHey look around, no don't look down\nYou can't ignore this bomb - it's ticking\nOpen your eyes, we've all gone blind\n\"I'm alright Jack!\" We've got to stop this thinking!\n\nDo you notice or do you care?\nAre you listening? Do you just stare?\nWhen you're walking in the streets today\nWill you just simply walk away?\n\nLook around in your own town\nDon't accept that we have to take this\nA bus stop bed, no place to rest\nIt's in your hands, only you can fix this\n\nDo you notice or do you care?\nAre you listening? Do you just stare?\nWhen you're walking in the streets today\nWill you just simply walk away?\n\nTurn your back & walk the other way\nTurn your head and look the other way\nWill you simply just walk away?", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Area-7"}
