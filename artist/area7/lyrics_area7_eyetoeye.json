(x2)\n\nSo here we are at the same place again\nAnother night, nothing happening\nI got excited when you leaned on me\nBut then you never say what you mean\nWhy did you ask me out tonight?\nWhy call me up and say the time is right?\nNow its time to put down my head\nWith or without you I'm going to bed\n\nSaw what you did, heard what you say\nWhat the hell are you doing here anyway? (x4)\n\nYou know we never see eye to eye\nTry to explain and you ask me why\nA sinking feeling when I see you there\nI should have known that you would never care\nWhy did you ask me out tonight?\nWhy call me up and say the time is right?\nNow its time to put down my head\nWith or without you I'm going to bed\n\nSaw what you did, heard what you say\nWhat the hell are you doing here anyway?
