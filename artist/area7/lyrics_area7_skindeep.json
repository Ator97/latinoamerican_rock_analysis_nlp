Is only skin deep\nHe tried so hard not to act like a white sheep\nHe wonders why everybody thinks he seems so strange...\nWell it really doesn't matter when reality is only skin deep\n\nAn accident, changed the course of his life\nHis whole world had changed in a single night\nHe tried his best to hide his face from the world\nHe tried to get away from it all\nBut no one seemed to care about him\nNobody cared at all...\n\nReality... Is only skin deep\nHe tried so hard not to act like a white sheep\nHe wonders why everybody thinks he seems so strange...\nWell it really doesn't matter when reality is only skin deep\n\nRight from the start his way of life was doomed\nHe kept his single life, locked in his single room\nNobody ever knew about it...\nThey never knew there was something wrong\nHis plastic world, could never last too long...\n\nReality... Is only skin deep\nHe tried so hard not to act like a white sheep\nHe wonders why everybody thinks he seems so strange...\nWell it really doesn't matter when reality is only skin deep\n\nI said it really doesn't matter when reality is only skin deep\nYeah it really doesn't matter when reality is only skin deep", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Area-7"}
