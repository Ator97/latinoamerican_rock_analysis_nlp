Hey! Hey!\n\nEasy to disturb\nWith a thought\nWith a whisper...\nWith a careless memory\nWith a careless memory\n\nGo! Go! Go!\n\nSo I walk out into the sun\nI try to start a new day\nBut the whole place\nJust screams in my eyes\nSo where are you now?\nCoz I don't want to see you\nI think I'd die\nI think I'd laugh at you\nI know I'd cry\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nFollow you?\n\nOutside the thoughts\nCome flooding back now...\nI tried to forget you...\n\nEasy to disturb\nWith a thought...\nWith a whisper...\nWith a careless memory...\nWith a careless memory...\nWith a careless memory...\nWith a careless memory...\n\nLook out! Look out! Look out!", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Area-7"}
