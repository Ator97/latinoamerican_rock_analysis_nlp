(spined in a row!)\nThese steps keep on growing long (spined as an arrow!)\nBayonet trials\nRust propellers await\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody is heard\nRowing sheep smiles for the dead\nNobody is heard\n\n[Verse 2]\nAn antiquated home\nAfloat with engines on mute\nSui generis ship spined around the yard\nIs anybody there? (spined in a row!)\nThese craft only multiply (spined as an arrow!)\nAt the nape of ruins\nRust propellers await!\nNoooo!\n\n[Chorus 2]\nNobody is heard\nCompass wilting in the wind\n(kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod, kcab nrut t'nod)\nNobody is heard\nRowing sheep smile for the dead\nTrans-oceanic depths in this earth\nIn this cenotaph\n\n[Bridge]\nLash of a thousand eye-brows clicking\nCounting the toll, counting the toll\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou've got the lot to burn\nA shelve of pig-smothered cries\nIs there a spirit that spits\nUpon the exit of signs?\nIs anybody there?
