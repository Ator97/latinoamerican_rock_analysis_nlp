Sobbing from the smacking mouth of the demagogue wells, making wisecracks, spilling from the corners with their pink flinches, second glancing their every move\nIt ate pickled nose cartilage that fell from the ceilings, a pork skin drizzle unnerving the humans, while it read aloud from its favorite books, in glossolalia slang and haruspex truths, following a slow and patient wait, a mocking their hair as it was glued to their upper lip combover\nUnder the wall, the ships smeared by faithfully talking the magnum fanatics and their bottles of scalp soup\nThey cooked up a tardis smudge on their eyes, a lunar antidote that powdered underneath the oncoming pestilence of their idling fingers\nIt wrote them a seance, penetrated their every dependent desire\nIt hacked off the central headpiece to the collective\nIt wrote them a message in the marrow of the knife, with the extension of Baphomet* transfusion\nGlued to the animals, perversions of their former selves, patiently biting their fingernails looking for a clue\nAs soon as it failed to appear, the faithful fell under the spell of public execution\nIt had been an eternity filled with useless ritual, and all for nothing, promising salvation, but only flags came swarming around for a better taste\nWhat was left were the scraps, dressed in animal skin, defiled servants holding their breath, fatherless culprits blaming their kin, waiting for an answer\nThey thought a day would come, or a giraffe might choke in midair squeal, some sort of indication\nOnly it was the hands of the followers that had left their markings in neatly packed dunes filled with the decapitated remains, found sealed in sand\nIt only stained the conscious for a brief moment, then came disgust\nRealizing there was nothing to it, people began collapsing in collective states of drought\nPalm-size vents heating in the chest, cluttering the graph, a bladder full of remains\nNothing became of them because nothing was the reason, an apathetic display dripping into vats of obesity\nThe feud had been sucking teeth for some time now, but the only baggage that paraded about was the curtain epidermis unfolded in an inebriated suit\nThe fit came suffocating, feathering the boa-constricted paleness, frostbitten, and shovel-faced\nIt came before them in utter confidence, flares of pink owls in the nest of albino eyelids blinking out chemical obscurities to the blind\nIt bloomed into a hemorrhaged contraption that impopulated the disenchanted, one by one\nAll the churches were converted into quarantine facilities, inside them grew bacterial stubble compacted by larvae, contracting and teething\nA newborn litter degradively sufficient, running from the horse collarbone, amongst the murmuring femurs whimpering in fractures\n\"Are you the Polaroid shot you thought you were?\", it said with a coy smirk\nWith the position now vacant, it waltzed right in and made itself at home\nSeduced by the empty nominations at the altar of broken ballot boxes, closer to that nothingness that everyone seemed to embrace\nAs it pissed all over them, the sigh of relief steamed off the soaking depressants, an impending sleep was on its way", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8ba8a66b9d1f27f224d0583217254221.288x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Mars Volta"}
