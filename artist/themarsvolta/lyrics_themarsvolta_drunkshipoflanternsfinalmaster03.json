(Spines in a row)\nThese steps keep on growing long (Spite as an arrow)\nBayonet trials rust, propellers await\n\nNo\nNobody is heard\nRowing sheep smiles for the dead\n\nNobody is heard\n\nAn antiquated home\nAfloat with engines on mute\nSui generis ships spined around the yard\n\nIs anybody there? (Spines in a row)\nThese craft only multiply (Spite as an arrow)\nAt the nape of ruins rust propellers await\n\nNo\nNobody is heard\nCompass wilting in the wind\n\nNobody is heard\nRowing sheep smile for the dead\n\nTransoceanic depth in this earth\nIn this cenotaph\n\nLash of one thousand eyebrows clicking\nCounting the toll\nCounting the toll\n\nYou've got the lot to burn\nA shelve of pig-smothered cries\nIs there a spirit that spits\nUpon the exit of signs?\n\nIs anybody there? (Spines in a row)\nThese steps keep on growing long (Spite as an arrow)\nBayonet trials rust, propellers await\n\nNo\nNobody is heard\nCompass wilting in the wind\n\nNobody is heard\nRowing sheep smile for the dead\n\nTransoceanic depth in this earth\nIn this cenotaph\n\nCarpel jets\nHit the ground\nCarpel jets\nHit the ground\nCarpel jets\nHit the ground\nCarpel jets\nHit the ground\n\nLash of one thousand eyebrows clicking\nCounting the toll\nCounting the toll\nLash of one thousand eyebrows clicking\nCounting the toll\nCounting the toll", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2ae64398916291beaa07bc12e0716aea.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Mars Volta"}
