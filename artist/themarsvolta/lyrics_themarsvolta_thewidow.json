'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook at how they flock to him\nFrom an isle of open sores\nHe knows that the taste is such\nSuch to die for\nAnd I hear him every night on every street\nThe scales that do slither deliver me from\n\n[Chorus]\nFreeze without an answer\nFree from all the shame\nThen I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone\n\n[Bridge]\nOh lord, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm\nSaid I'm, bloodshot for sure\nPale runs the ghost, said I'm, said I'm\nSwollen on the shore, swollen on the shore\nIn every night, in every pore\nThe scales that do slither deliver me from\n\n[Chorus]\nFreeze without an answer\nFree with all the shame\nThen I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone\nFreeze without an answer\nFree from all the shame\nLet me die, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone\n\n[Instrumental - Album only]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8bbd0189bbb80f576a72d7c64cc6bfa4.850x850x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Mars Volta"}
