In Thirteen Seconds]\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's been thirteen seconds since you all last said\nI've become the apparition you predicted for my death\nYou said that flirting brings you closer to the end\nYou can bait into the water but you'll never get the hint\nAnd like a stain of bricks goes dancing by your head\nPlucked from an icebox, grafted on my skin\nIt's been thirteen seconds since you all last said\nI've become the apparition you predicted for my death\nYou said that flirting brings you closer to the end\nYou can bait into the water but you'll never get the hint\nAnd like a stain of bricks goes dancing by your head\nPlucked from an icebox, grafted on my skin\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy coat has hid the marks, mink hits the shovel fix\nNear the sway of pendulums, boar abrasions and a kiss\nShe said, \"I'll never let them hurt you, I'll never let them in\nWhat you took from me is mine and what is mine I'll never give\"\n\n[B. Nineteen Sank While Six Would Swim]\n\n[Verse 3]\nMascara glass in the molar weeds\nHer ash, a serpent infancy\nAnd his eye patch pussed through a gape of sand\nInto his shine a sedative (Into his shine a sedative)\nMore and more the dirt collects\nAnd you'll never find her body now\nIn a closet festered in secret air\nBlonde underneath her blackened hair\nAnd he never knew the colony\nGestated in his bed\nMingle with the carnivores\nYou've something both in common now\nTill one day his wasted breath\nSwollen throat and karma debt\nSet foot inside a parlor\nTo find her drunken by receipts\nHe held her by the ankles\nGutted at the nave\nYes gutted and depraved\nHe tied a rope around her legs\nAnd let her hang for seven days\n\n[C. Five Would Grow And One Was Dead]\n\n[Outro]\nThis never happened, but I saw you leave\nAnd crawl into a bed of broken windows\nThis never happened, but I saw you leave\nAnd crawl into a bed of broken windows\nThis never happened, but I saw you leave\nAnd crawl into a bed of broken windows\nThis never happened, but I saw you leave\nAnd crawl into a bed of broken windows\nThis never happened\n\n[D. Sarcophagi]\n\n[Instrumental]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/dfab62c52d1ffe986747dfb0ba27ef94.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Mars Volta"}
