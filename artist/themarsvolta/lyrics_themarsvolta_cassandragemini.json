become one of the others, oh, oh, oh\nI think I've become... one of the others, oh, oh, yeah yeah\n\nPlant a Nail in the Navel Stream (0:39-4:46)\n\n[Interlude]\nThere was a frail syrup dripping off his lap danced lapel\nPunctuated by her decrepit prowl she\nWashed down the hatching gizzard\nSoft as a mane of needles\nHis orifice icicles hemorrhaged by combing her torso to a pile\nPerspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse\nShe was a mink hand job in sarcophagus heels\n\n[Verse 1]\nBring me to my knees, read the sharpened lines\nAll my arms bled me blind\nFaucet leaks in shadows, spilling from\nMorgue lancet caressed your fontanelle\nI've sworn to kill every last one\nEvery last one\nPanic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms\nOnto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids\n\n[Chorus]\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll your dreams splintered off\nLeech by leech on this catafalque\nAnyone will tell you, yes, anyone\nChance had me setting a trip wire alarm\nYour mother flirted with disease\nWhen she skinned that costume by it's navel strings\nPanic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms\nOnto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids\n\n[Chorus]\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\n\n[Verse 3]\nShockless shackles free you\nVolt face cons\nAbandon you again\nI won't feel, not this time\nShockless shackles free you\nVolt face cons\nAbandon you again\nI won't feel, not this time, oh, yeah!\n\nFaminepulse (4:46-22:02)\n\n[Verse 4]\nBrick by brick the night eclipsed\nPricked by cuticle thorns\nDried the sleep on nursery slits\nInto this life I'm born\nHeaven's just a scab away\nI'd like to see you after just one taste\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Refrain]\nSink your teeth into the flesh of midnight\nNight forever more\nLet them see it has begun\nThe others I've become\n\n[Verse 5]\nIf you should see the dice\nCharmed with it's snaked choked eyes\nYou'll wear the widows weeds\nBecause they're just your size\n\n[Verse 6]\nBehind the snail secretion\nLeaves a dry heave that absorbs\nA limbless procreation\nLet the infant crawl deformed\nA bag replace the breath\nOf these suffocating sheets\nAnd now when the craving calls\nI'll scratch my itchy sheath\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd soon\nCome on\nIf you don't know\nCome on\nIf you don't know\nCome on\nIf you don't know\n\n[Refrain]\nSink your teeth into the flesh of midnight\nNight forever more\nSink your teeth into the flesh of midnight\nNight forever more\n\n[Verse 7]\nShe fell for the whispers\nSister flooded deaf tears\nThat night tore a river\nIn her barren womb mirror\nAnd his multiple sons\nWith their mandible tongues\nSet crucified fires to petrified homes\nL-L-L-L-L-L-L-Let it burn\nI want, I want, I want, I want to let it burn\n\n[Verse 8]\nAnd the owls they were watching\nAnd the owls didn't care\nThen the owls came a' knocking\nPlacenta in their stares\nThey will feed on all the carnage\nLeftover from the flood\nAnd in the corner of their eyes\nFled sister L'Via\nSister L'Via\n\n[Verse 9]\nNow the pieces went floating\nReflecting all at dusk\nConceived from the stabbing\nWas Vismund Cygnus\n\n[Bridge]\n25 wives in the lake tonight\n25 wives in the lake tonight\n25 wives in the lake tonight\n25 wives in the lake tonight\n25 wives in the lake tonight\n25 wives in the lake tonight\n\n[Verse 10]\n25 wives in the lake tonight\nRaw bark in the water of the marble shrine\n25 snakes pour out your eyes\nYeah, the ice picks coming on the marble shrine\n25 wives in the lake tonight\nRaw bark in the water of the marble shrine\n25 snakes pour out your eyes\nYeah, the ice picks coming, coming tonight\n25 wives in the lake tonight\nRaw bark in the water of the marble shrine\n25 snakes pour out your eyes\nYeah, the ice picks coming on the marble shrine\n25 wives in the lake tonight\nRaw bark in the water of the marble shrine\n25 snakes pour out your eyes\n25 snakes are drowning\nDrowning\nDrown\nDrowning\nDrowning\n25 more\n25 more\n25 more\n25 more\nWoahaoh\nWoah, woah\n\n[Verse 11]\nYou can't bend your crooked arms\nOr fold your punctured proof\nThe air is growing cold, cold, cold, cold, cold\nAnd there's nothing you can do\nSoon there'll be no gauze\nInside the confessional\nOnly rows of crows\nDefrocking every breath, breath, breath, breath\n\n[Verse 12]\nOne day you'll remember\nBehind the melting cones\nI said one day you'll remember\nBehind the melting cones\nYou've always had a family\nIn the burial of your home\nIn the burial of your home\nBurial of your home\nBurial of your home, ffffph\n\n[Verse 13]\nNot forevermore\nNot forevermore\nNot forevermore\nNot forevermore\nNot forevermore\nAnd I peel back all of my skin\nPeel it back let it all run\nPeel back all of my skin\nPeel it back let it all run\nPeel back all of my skin\n\nMultiple Spouse Wounds (22:02-31:37)\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 4]\nBrick by brick the night eclipsed\nPricked by cuticle thorns\nDried the sleep on nursery

darkest of your furthest reaches\nNo there's no light\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches\nNo there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, your life was just a lie)\nNo there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)\nIn the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, you ain't got-)\n\nSarcophagi (31:37-32:31)\n\n[Outro]\nThe ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens\nA depth perception languished in the night\nAll my life, I've been sewing the wounds\nBut the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud\nOoooh...", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8652220757a55991b2073b5effa1df9e.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Mars Volta"}
