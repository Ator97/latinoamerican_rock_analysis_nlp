Well, she got  to the dam and seen that 'twas givin' way - she was always great for knowin' all such things. And she just turned and ran. Jake Elder was up on the hill after a stray cow, and he seen her go. He was too far off to imagine what ailed her, but he said he never saw a woman run so in his life.\n\"And you'll believe it, she run right by her own house - never stopped - never looked at it. Just run for the village. Of course, she may have lost her head with the fright, but that wasn't like her. No, I think she had made up her mind to leave that innocent baby to die! She just ran down her and give warnin', and, of course, we sent word down valley on horseback, and there was no lives lost in all three villages. She started to run back as soon as we was 'roused, but 'twas too late then.\n\n\"Jake saw it all, though he was too far off to do a thing. He said he couldn't stir a foot, it was so awful. He seen the wagon drivin' along as nice as you please till it got close to the dam, and then Greenwood seemed to see the danger and shipped up like mad. He was the father, you know. But he wasn't quite in time - the dam give way and the water went over him like a tidal wave. She was almost to the gate when it struck the house and her - we never found her body nor his for days and days. They was washed clear down river.\n\n\"Don't tell me!\" said old Mis' Briggs, with a forbidding shake of the head. \"No mother that was a mother would desert her own child for anything on earth!\"\n\n\"You don't any of you seem to think what she did for all of us - if she hadn't left hers we should all have lost ours, sure.\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/96021e21f9d825493e0f393a6aee9fe0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman"}
