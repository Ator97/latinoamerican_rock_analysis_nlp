She was so nice to us children... most girls that age won't have anything to do with little ones. But she was kind and pleasant.\"\n\n-\"And if you'll believe it, she run right by her own house- never stopped- never looked back at it. Just run for the village.\nOf course, she may have lost her head with the fright, but that wasn't like her. No, I think she had made up her mind to leave that innocent baby to die!\nShe just ran down here and give warnin'... and there was no lives lost in all three villages. She started to run back as soon as we was 'roused, but 'twas too late then.\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/96021e21f9d825493e0f393a6aee9fe0.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman"}
