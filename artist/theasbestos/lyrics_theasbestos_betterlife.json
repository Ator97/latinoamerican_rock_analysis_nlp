Bad gone Rich...\nPriestess with no right to preach...\nLife... life... life... life...\nBut I'm here, I'm here and a new world will come\nI'm here, I'm here and a new world will come\n\nAfter seen all that I have been through\nHow can you judge what I've done?\nHave you seen all that I've begged and begged for a better life?\n\nYes in my life I've caused troubles\nI fought fights, fights between religion and science\nFeared everything's lost. I've feared what they'll think of me...\nVanity but I'm here...\n\nI'm here and a new world will come\nHere, I'm here and a new world will come\n\nAfter seen all that I have been through\nHow can you judge what I've done?\nHave you seen all that I've begged and begged for a better life?\n\nI'm singing at the doors of heaven\nI'm singing 'cause I can't get in\nThey say everything will be alright\nWhen they know where to send my soul...\nBut you are no one to blame\nKid you are no one to blame\n\nAfter seen all that I have been through\nHow can you judge what I've done?\nHave you seen all that I've begged and begged for a better life?\n\nAfter seen all that I have been through\nHow can you judge what I've done?\nHave you seen all that I've begged and begged for a better life?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7b65eb9ccf422877280a9f27d0224418.350x294x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Asbestos"}
