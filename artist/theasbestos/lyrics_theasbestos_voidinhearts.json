(Wow woho)\nWe're running out of clovers and clever lies for lovers\n\nI want my life back!\n\nI clench my fist every time he smiles\nIf it wasn't for him we would be alright by now\nI'm spending my nights alone\n\nI feel a lot better now\nScars are forever, hun\nWe are running out of Hearts to play with\n\nWhen the stars are up above\nI'll be drinking all my lost\nWould be proud if you had listen\nThat I gave you all my trust\n\nWhen the stars are up above\nI'll be drinking all my lost\nWould be proud if you had listen\nMy advice alright!\n\nCroupier said that she's been lying\nCroupier said that she never had a heart to give\nSince I don't have anything to lose\nShare your love with me so I can gamble again\n\nFeel a lot better;\nScars are forever, you'll see what I mean\nFeel a lot better;\nScars are forever, play this void in...\nPlay this void in...
