They don't exist)\n(We're supposed to protect our people, not destroy them)\n(Look at his arms, he loves that shit more than he loves us)\n(At 10:05 a ki is...\nYou can't lose money no way\nWe make 75 million on this deal, right?\n75 million...)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7bbbab41ca1f39023990146487a19b6.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Nemesis"}
