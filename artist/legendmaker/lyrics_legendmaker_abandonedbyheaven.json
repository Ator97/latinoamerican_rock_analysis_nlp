Solo: Mauricio]\nFarewell to paradise\nFarewell to sanctity\nI mark my pace with blood\nI am forever free\nAs we lived in chaos our gates were denied\nBanned in our faith on our one selfish God\nIn this world of madness, Salvation will die\nI see no tomorrow, as we blacken the sky", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Legend Maker"}
