Solo: Mauricio]\n[Solo: Santiago]\nThis is the way, the only way\nAll they suffer for the cause of the selfish ones\nA new race shall come\nTo do the things the way it should've been done\n\n[Chorus]", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Legend Maker"}
