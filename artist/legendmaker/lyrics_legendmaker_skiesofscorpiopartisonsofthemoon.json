Solo: Luisfer. Solo: Santiago. Solo Mauricio]\n\n[All vocal melodies and vocal arrangements: Diego Gomez]\n\n[Part II : Age of Battle]\n\nMy eyes see hate, My heart feels not\nThe day is gray, and the blood has come\nMake the sacrifice and the battle is here\nPrepare the throne cause the old king is dead\nHear me when I curse your name\nWhen I scream to the skies\nLord of Scorpio, you shall kneel\nAnd feel my steel\nMy kingdom is one again\nThe war is now ceased\nAnd skies belong to me\nThe dark is back to it's own hell\nBut it will return\nAnd so will my sword", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Legend Maker"}
