And which parts?\nDid it take long? And did we work hard?\nDid everything almost fall apart when we found out that Key! was gone?\nCould\u2019ve sworn that I said this what\u2019s going on\nAm I stuck in a twilight zone, you know ever since I did Styrofoam\nI could\u2019ve sworn y\u2019all were living it, goddamn I guess I was wrong\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/05eb105aa7ffeee7744fb787a1d1ef6b.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Jace"}
