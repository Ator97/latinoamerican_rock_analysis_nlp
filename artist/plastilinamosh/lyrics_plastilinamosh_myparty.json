I like her pretty face, it puts me in my place\nHere's some lemon and some salt for your icy cold cerveza\nI like to sit and watch her, shake her baby maker\nDon't be rude, pull out the mace, I like your face, I love your body...\n\nCHORUS (everybody wants to go to my party)\n\n... even George Bush... With his buddy Danny Bonadouche... , I mean, Danny Bonaduce\nFlavor Flav and Gary Busey, Gary Coleman begged me please\nKenny G got on his knees, Richard Simmons, Baby Spice\nRon Jeremy, Vanilla Ice...\n\nCHORUS (everybody wants to go to my party)\n\nGet drunk, get laid and drink Bacardi, HEY!\nIs that Barry Manilow? I hope so 'cause I'm a fanilow\nMarc Anthony, Jennifer Lo, Mencia Carlos, Lopez Mario\nThey all get down, they all get naughty, funkity funk playin' at my party...\n\nCHORUS (everybody wants to go to my party)\n\n... even The Police... Not Summers, Copeland or Sting... the kinda cops that don't sing\nRing a ding ding, cell phones covered in bling bling\nTryin' to get in the VIP area, only for Madonna and Mariah\nThey all get down, they all get naughty, shakin' bakin' at my party...\n\nCHORUS (everybody wants to go to my party)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/503677a96d74101c0323514b476300cd.952x952x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Plastilina Mosh"}
