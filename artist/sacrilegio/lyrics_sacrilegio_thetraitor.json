Lara\nSolo D. Ortiz\n\nThirty pieces was his price\nFor his treason and demise\nThe master who gave him only love\nBut he forgot who he was\n\nLife taking by his own hand\nNever understood the end\nAcces to forgivness had\nBut he preferres to die at last", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Sacrilegio"}
