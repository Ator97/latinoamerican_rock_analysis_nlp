Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???\n\nThe issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton\u2019s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir\n\n[JEFFERSON]\n\u2018Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u2019\nWe fought for these ideals; we shouldn\u2019t settle for less\nThese are wise words, enterprising men quote \u2018em\nDon\u2019t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote \u2018em\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nOww\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nBut Hamilton forgets\nHis plan would have the government assume state\u2019s debts\nNow, place your bets as to who that benefits:\nThe very seat of government where Hamilton sits\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNot true!\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nOoh, if the shoe fits, wear it\nIf New York\u2019s in debt\u2014\nWhy should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I\u2019m afraid\nDon\u2019t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade\nIn Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground\nWe create. You just wanna move our money around\nThis financial plan is an outrageous demand\nAnd it\u2019s too many damn pages for any man to understand\nStand with me in the land of the free\nAnd pray to God we never see Hamilton\u2019s candidacy\nLook, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky\nImagine what gon\u2019 happen when you try to tax our whisky\n\n[WASHINGTON & CROWD]\nThank you, Secretary Jefferson\nThat's my alcohol!\nSecretary Hamilton, your response\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThomas. That was a real nice declaration\nWelcome to the present, we\u2019re running a real nation\nWould you like to join us, or stay mellow\nDoin\u2019 whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?\nIf we assume the debts, the union gets\nA new line of credit, a financial diuretic\nHow do you not get it? If we\u2019re aggressive and competitive\nThe union gets a boost. You\u2019d rather give it a sedative?\nA civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor\nYour debts are paid cuz you don\u2019t pay for labor\n\u201cWe plant seeds in the South. We create.\u201d\nYeah, keep ranting\nWe know who\u2019s really doing the planting\nAnd another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment\nDon\u2019t lecture me about the war, you didn\u2019t fight in it\nYou think I\u2019m frightened of you, man?\nWe almost died in the trench\nWhile you were off getting high with the French\nThomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President\nReticent\u2014there isn\u2019t a plan he doesn\u2019t jettison\nMadison, you\u2019re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine\nDamn, you\u2019re in worse shape than the national debt is in\nSittin\u2019 there useless as two shits\nHey, turn around, bend over, I\u2019ll show you\nWhere my shoe fits\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nExcuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We\u2019ll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSir!\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nA word\n\n[MADISON]\nYou don\u2019t have the votes\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nYou don\u2019t have the votes\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nAha-ha-ha ha!\n\n[JEFFERSON/MADISON]\nYou\u2019re gonna need congressional approval and you don\u2019t have the votes\n\n[JEFFERSON]\nSuch a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder\n\n[MADISON]\nWhy he even brings the thunder\u2026\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYou wanna pull yourself together?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI\u2019m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYoung man, I\u2019m from Virginia, so watch your mouth\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo we let Congress get held hostage by the South?\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYou need the votes\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNo, we need bold strokes. We need this plan\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nNo, you need to convince more folks\n\n[HAMILTON]\nJames Madison won\u2019t talk to me, that\u2019s a nonstarter\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nWinning was easy, young man. Governing\u2019s harder\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThey\u2019re being intransigent\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nYou have to find a compromise\n\n[HAMILTON]\nBut they don\u2019t have a plan, they just hate mine!\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nConvince them otherwise\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t get congressional approval?\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nI imagine they\u2019ll call for your removal\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSir\u2014\n\n[WASHINGTON]\nFigure it out, Alexander.
