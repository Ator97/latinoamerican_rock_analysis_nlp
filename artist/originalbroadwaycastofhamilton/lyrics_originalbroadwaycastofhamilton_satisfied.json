What the hell is the catch? It\u2019s\nThe feeling of freedom, of seein\u2019 the light\nIt\u2019s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?\nThe conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes\nEv\u2019rything we said in total agreement, it\u2019s\nA dream and it\u2019s a bit of a dance\nA bit of a posture, it\u2019s a bit of a stance.
