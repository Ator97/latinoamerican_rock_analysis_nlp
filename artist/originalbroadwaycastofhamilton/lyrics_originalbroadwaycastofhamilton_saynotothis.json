I\u2019ll let him tell it\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI hadn\u2019t slept in a week\nI was weak, I was awake\nYou never seen a bastard orphan\nMore in need of a break\nLonging for Angelica\nMissing my wife\nThat\u2019s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:\n\n[MARIA]\nI know you are a man of honor\nI\u2019m so sorry to bother you at home\nBut I don\u2019t know where to go, and I came here all alone\u2026\n\n[HAMILTON]\nShe said:\n\n[MARIA]\nMy husband\u2019s doin\u2019 me wrong\nBeatin\u2019 me, cheatin\u2019 me, mistreatin\u2019 me...\nSuddenly he\u2019s up and gone\nI don\u2019t have the means to go on\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said\n\n[MARIA]\nYou\u2019re too kind, sir\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away\nShe lived a block away, she said:\n\n[MARIA]\nThis one\u2019s mine, sir\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThen I said, \u201cwell, I should head back home,\u201d\nShe turned red, she led me to her bed\nLet her legs spread and said:\n\n[MARIA]\nStay?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nHey\u2026\n\n[MARIA]\nHey\u2026\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThat\u2019s when I began to pray:\nLord, show me how to\nSay no to this\nI don\u2019t know how to\nSay no to this\n\nBut my God, she looks so helpless\nAnd her body\u2019s saying, \u201chell, yes\u201d\n\n[MARIA]\nWhoa...\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNooo, show me how to\n\n[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]\nSay no to this\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI don\u2019t know how to\n\n[HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE]\nSay no to this\n\n[HAMILTON]\nIn my mind, I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to go\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nGo! Go! Go!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nThen her mouth is on mine, and I don\u2019t say\u2026\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\nNo! No!\nSay no to this!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI wish I could say that was the last time\nI said that last time. It became a pastime\nA month into this endeavor I received a letter\nFrom a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:\n\n[JAMES]\nDear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health\nAnd in a prosperous enough position to put wealth\nIn the pockets of people like me: down on their luck\nYou see, that was my wife who you decided to\n\n[HAMILTON]\nFuuuu\u2014\n\n[JAMES]\nUh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold\nSo time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled\nAnd hey, you can keep seein\u2019 my whore wife\nIf the price is right: if not I\u2019m telling your wife\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI hid the letter and I raced to her place\nScreamed \u201cHow could you?!\u201d in her face\nShe said:\n\n[MARIA]\nNo, sir!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nHalf dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked\nPathetic, she cried:\n\n[MARIA]\nPlease don\u2019t go, sir!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSo was your whole story a setup?\n\n[MARIA]\nI don\u2019t know about any letter!\n\n[HAMILTON]\nStop crying\nGoddamnit, get up!\n\n[MARIA]\nI didn\u2019t know any better\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI am ruined...\n\n[MARIA & HAMILTON]\nPlease don\u2019t leave me with him helpless (I am helpless\u2014how could I do this?)\nJust give him what he wants and you can have me\nI don\u2019t want you\nWhatever you want (I don\u2019t want you)\n\n[MARIA, HAMILTON, & ENSEMBLE]\nIf you pay (I don\u2019t\u2026)\nYou can stay\nLord, show me how to\nSay no to this (Say no to this!)\nTonight (I don\u2019t know how to)\n(Say no to this!)\nSay no to this\n'Cause the situation\u2019s helpless (Helpless)\nAnd her body\u2019s screaming, \u201cHell, yes\u201d (Whoa!)\nHow can you (No, show me how to)\n(Say no to this!)\nSay no to this? (Say no to this)\n(Say no to this!)\nHow can I say no to this?\nThere is nowhere I can go (Go! Go!
