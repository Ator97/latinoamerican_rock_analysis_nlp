He passes every day\nThey say he walks the length of the city\n\n[HAMILTON]\nYou knock me out, I fall apart\n\n[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)]\nCan you imagine?\n\n[HAMILTON]\nLook at where we are\nLook at where we started\nI know I don\u2019t deserve you, Eliza\nBut hear me out. That would be enough\n\nIf I could spare his life\nIf I could trade his life for mine\nHe\u2019d be standing here right now\nAnd you would smile, and that would be enough\nI don\u2019t pretend to know\nThe challenges we\u2019re facing\nI know there\u2019s no replacing what we\u2019ve lost\nAnd you need time\nBut I\u2019m not afraid\nI know who I married\nJust let me stay here by your side\nThat would be enough\n\n[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)]\nIf you see him in the street, walking by her\nSide, talking by her side, have pity\n\n[HAMILTON]\nEliza, do you like it uptown? It\u2019s quiet uptown\n\n[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)]\nHe is trying to do the unimaginable\nSee them walking in the park, long after dark\nTaking in the sights of the city\n\n[HAMILTON]\nLook around, look around, Eliza\n\n[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)]\nThey are trying to do the unimaginable\n\n[ANGELICA]\nThere are moments that the words don\u2019t reach\nThere is a grace too powerful to name\nWe push away what we can never understand\nWe push away the unimaginable\nThey are standing in the garden\nAlexander by Eliza\u2019s side\nShe takes his hand\n\n[ELIZA]\nIt\u2019s quiet uptown\n\n[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)]\nForgiveness. Can you imagine?\nForgiveness. Can you imagine?\nIf you see him in the street, walking by her\nSide, talking by her side, have pity\nThey are going through the unimaginable", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7d3cc1593a5c1521f6b504313f62333.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton"}
