Secretary Hamilton, your response\n\n[Hamilton]\nYou must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think\nThe President is gonna bring the nation to the brink\nOf meddling in the middle of a military mess\nA game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless\nWe signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket\nWould you like to take it out and ask it?\n\u201cShould we honor our treaty, King Louis\u2019 head?\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2026 do whatever you want, I\u2019m super dead.\u201d\n\n[Washington]\nEnough. Hamilton is right\n\n[Jefferson]\nMr. President\u2014\n\n[Washington]\nWe\u2019re too fragile to start another fight\n\n[Jefferson]\nBut sir, do we not fight for freedom?\n\n[Washington]\nSure, when the French figure out who\u2019s gonna lead \u2018em\n\n[Jefferson]\nThe people are leading\u2014\n\n[Washington]\nThe people are rioting\nThere\u2019s a difference. Frankly, it\u2019s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality\nHamilton\n\n[Hamilton]\nSir\n\n[Washington]\nDraft a statement of neutrality\n\n[Jefferson]\nDid you forget Lafayette?\n\n[Hamilton]\nWhat?\n\n[Jefferson]\nHave you an ounce of regret?\nYou accumulate debt, you accumulate power\nYet in their hour of need, you forget\n\n[Hamilton]\nLafayette\u2019s a smart man, he\u2019ll be fine\nAnd before he was your friend, he was mine\nIf we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop\nWhere do we draw the line?\n\n[Jefferson]\nSo quick-witted\n\n[Hamilton]\nAlas, I admit it\n\n[Jefferson]\nI bet you were quite a lawyer\n\n[Hamilton]\nMy defendants got acquitted\n\n[Jefferson]\nYeah. Well, someone oughta remind you\n\n[Hamilton]\nWhat?\n\n[Jefferson]\nYou\u2019re nothing without Washington behind you\n\n[Washington]\nHamilton!\n\n[Jefferson]\nDaddy\u2019s calling!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7d3cc1593a5c1521f6b504313f62333.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton"}
