I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to watch the show!\n\n[PHILIP]\nYa\u2019 shoulda watched your mouth before you\nTalked about my father though!\n\n[GEORGE]\nI didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true\nYour father\u2019s a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nOoooooooooh!\n\n[PHILIP]\nIt\u2019s like that?\n\n[GEORGE]\nYeah, I don\u2019t fool around\nI\u2019m not your little schoolboy friends\n\n[PHILIP]\nSee you on the dueling ground\nThat is, unless you wanna step outside and go now\n\n[GEORGE]\nI know where to find you, piss off\nI\u2019m watchin\u2019 this show now\n\nShh\n\n[PHILIP]\nPops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you\nI doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to\u2014\n\n[HAMILTON]\nSlow down\n\n[PHILIP]\nI came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel\nThey don\u2019t exactly cover this subject in boarding school\n\n[HAMILTON]\nDid your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?\n\n[PHILIP]\nHe refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease\n\n[HAMILTON]\nWhere is this happening?\n\n[PHILIP]\nAcross the river, in Jersey\n\n[HAMILTON/PHILIP]\nEverything is legal in New Jersey\u2026\n\n[HAMILTON]\nAlright. So this is what you\u2019re gonna do:\nStand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you\nWhen the time comes, fire your weapon in the air\nThis will put an end to the whole affair\n\n[PHILIP]\nBut what if he decides to shoot? Then I\u2019m a goner\n\n[HAMILTON]\nNo. He\u2019ll follow suit if he\u2019s truly a man of honor\nTo take someone\u2019s life, that is something you can\u2019t shake\nPhilip, your mother can\u2019t take another heartbreak\n\n[PHILIP]\nFather\u2014\n\n[HAMILTON]\nPromise me. You don\u2019t want this\nYoung man\u2019s blood on your conscience\n\n[PHILIP]\nOkay, I promise\n\n[HAMILTON]\nCome back home when you\u2019re done\nTake my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son\n\n[PHILIP]\nMy name is Philip\nI am a poet\nI\u2019m a little nervous, but I can\u2019t show it\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a Hamilton with pride\nYou talk about my father, I cannot let it slide\nMister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?\n\n[GEORGE]\nI\u2019d rather skip the pleasantries\nLet\u2019s go\nGrab your pistol\n\n[PHILIP]\nConfer with your men\nThe duel will commence after we count to ten\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nCount to ten!\n\n[PHILIP]\nLook \u2018em in the eye, aim no higher\nSummon all the courage you require\nThen slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky\u2014\n\n[MALE ENSEMBLE]\nOne two three four\n\n[FULL ENSEMBLE]\nFive six seven\u2014", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7d3cc1593a5c1521f6b504313f62333.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton"}
