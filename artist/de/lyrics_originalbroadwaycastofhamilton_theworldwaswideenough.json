Van Ness signed on as my\u2014\n\n[BURR AND COMPANY]\nNumber two!\n\n[BURR]\nHamilton arrived with his crew:\nNathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew\n\n[COMPANY]\nNumber three!\n\n[BURR]\nI watched Hamilton examine the terrain\nI wish I could tell you what was happ\u2019ning in his brain\nThis man has poisoned my political pursuits!\n\n[COMPANY]\nMost disputes die and no one shoots!\nNumber four!\n\n[BURR]\nHamilton drew first position\nLooking, to the world, like a man on a mission\nThis is a soldier with a marksman\u2019s ability\nThe doctor turned around so he could have deniability\n\n[COMPANY]\nFive!\n\n[BURR]\nNow I didn\u2019t know this at the time\nBut we were\u2014\n\n[BURR AND PHILIP & HAMILTON]\nNear the same spot (Near the same spot)\nYour son died, is that (My son died, is that)\nWhy\u2014(Why\u2014)\n\n[COMPANY]\nSix!\n\n[BURR]\nHe examined his gun with such rigor?\nI watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger\n\n[COMPANY]\nSeven!\n\n[BURR]\nConfession time? Here\u2019s what I got:\nMy fellow soldiers\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m a terrible shot\n\n[COMPANY]\nNumber eight!\n\n[BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN]\nYour last chance to negotiate\nSend in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight\n\n[BURR]\nThey won\u2019t teach you this in your classes\nBut look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses\nWhy? If not to take deadly aim?\nIt\u2019s him or me, the world will never be the same\nI had only one thought before the slaughter:\nThis man will not make an orphan of my daughter\n\n[COMPANY]\nNumber nine!\n\n[BURR]\nLook him in the eye, aim no higher\nSummon all the courage you require\nThen count:\n\n[COMPANY]\nOne two three four five six seven eight nine\nNumber ten paces! Fire!\u2014\n\n[HAMILTON]\nI imagine death so much it feels more like a memory\nIs this where it gets me, on my feet, sev\u2019ral feet ahead of me?\nI see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?\nThere is no beat, no melody\nBurr, my first friend, my enemy\nMaybe the last face I ever see\nIf I throw away my shot, is this how you\u2019ll remember me?\nWhat if this bullet is my legacy?\n\nLegacy. What is a legacy?\nIt\u2019s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see\nI wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me\nAmerica, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me\nYou let me make a difference\nA place where even orphan immigrants\nCan leave their fingerprints and rise up\nI\u2019m running out of time. I\u2019m running, and my time\u2019s up\nWise up. Eyes up\nI catch a glimpse of the other side\nLaurens leads a soldiers\u2019 chorus on the other side\nMy son is on the other side\nHe\u2019s with my mother on the other side\nWashington is watching from the other side\n\nTeach me how to say goodbye\n\nRise up, rise up, rise up\nEliza\n\nMy love, take your time\nI\u2019ll see you on the other side\nRaise a glass to freedom...\n\n[BURR AND COMPANY]\nHe aims his pistol at the sky\u2014\n\n[BURR]\nWait!\n\n[BURR]\nI strike him right between his ribs\nI walk towards him, but I am ushered away\nThey row him back across the Hudson\nI get a drink\n\n[COMPANY]\nAaaah\nAaaah\nAaaah\n\n[BURR]\nI hear wailing in the streets\n\n[COMPANY]\nAaaah\nAaaah\nAaaah\n\n[BURR]\nSomebody tells me, \u201cYou\u2019d better hide.\u201d\n\n[COMPANY]\nAaaah\nAaaah\nAaaah\n\n[BURR]\nThey say\n\n[BURR AND ANGELICA]\nAngelica and Eliza\u2014\n\n[BURR]\nWere both at his side when he died\nDeath doesn\u2019t discriminate\nBetween the sinners and the saints\nIt takes and it takes and it takes\nHistory obliterates\nIn every picture it paints\nIt paints me and all my mistakes\nWhen Alexander aimed\nAt the sky\nHe may have been the first one to die\nBut I\u2019m the one who paid for it\n\nI survived, but I paid for it\n\nNow I\u2019m the villain in your history\nI was too young and blind to see...\nI should\u2019ve known\nI should\u2019ve known\nThe world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me\nThe world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e7d3cc1593a5c1521f6b504313f62333.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton"}
