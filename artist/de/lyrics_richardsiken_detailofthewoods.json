A heart, closing. Nevertheless.\n\nEveryone needs a place. It shouldn\u2019t be inside of someone else.\nI kept my mind on the moon. Cold moon, long nights moon.\n\nFrom the landscape: a sense of scale.\nFrom the dead: a sense of scale.\n\nI turned my back on the story. A sense of superiority.\nEverything casts a shadow.\n\nYour body told me in a dream it\u2019s never been afraid of anything.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/b3f834173eb5f28f99b9027877836166.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
