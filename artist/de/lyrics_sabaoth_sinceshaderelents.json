Done am I above all\nWith the narrowed lips, the sneer\nThe heartless wit that laughed where one should sigh\n\n\u00a1Away!\nClenched fist and bosom's angry swell\nThat knave and fool at every turn abound\n\u00a1Away!\nHard unforgivingness\nFarewell\nOblivion in a hated brewage found\n\nYes, calm I mean to walk through life, and straight\nPatient of all, unanxious of the goal\n(Void of all)\nEnvy\nViolence\nHate\n\nAnd as I may, to lighten the long way\nGo singing airs ingenuous and brave\nShe'll listen to me graciously (I say)\nAnd, verily, no other heaven i crave\n\nNo other heaven I crave", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Sabaoth"}
