Face is full of mischief\nQuestioning your persistence\nLike before, you never even listened\nForgot just what you've been missing\n\n[Pre-Hook 2]\nDon't forget who you are\nDon't forget you're a star\nI've found eutopia\nIt's never far\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat you've never done before, it can set you on your way\nMaybe we can even meet along the way\nShow you heaven through the door, leave the work and start to play\nMaybe we can even meet along the way\n\nFind eutopia\nIt's never far\n\n[Hook]\n\nIt's never far\nIt's never far", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c3a19f1fd21cd321c572a7e4e5317799.618x620x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Example"}
