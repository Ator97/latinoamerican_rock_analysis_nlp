That means it's noon, that means\n\nwe're inconsolable.\n\nTell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.\n\nThese, our bodies, possessed by light.\n\nTell me we'll never get used to it.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
