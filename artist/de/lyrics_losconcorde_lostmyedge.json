I lost my touch?\nDoes it really matter that much?\nHave I lost my edge? lost my style?\nWill it be gone after a while?\nHave I lost my head? am I a fool?\nMaybe I've never even been that cool!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/49468c62549ed8608e2a8cc1a2501cd9.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Los Concorde"}
