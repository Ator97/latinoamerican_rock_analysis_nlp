Again, melody and chords very temp.\u00a0\n\n(sung)\nHey cutie, don't know if you knew\nBut I've got a little girl crush on you\nSo do you want to get a little crazy tonight?\n(Tonight, tonight, tonight)\n\nYou're everything that I wish I could be\nGonna tell ya all the naughty things I wanna do to you\n(Tee-hee-hee!)\n\nI wanna lock you in a basement with soundproof walls\nAnd take over your identity\nI wanna cut the silky hair right off your head\nAnd slurp it up like spaghetti\n\nWanna clone you and consume you\nWanna own you and cartoon you\nFly your dirty panties like a kite\n\nBum-pum-pum\n\n'Cause I'm feelin' kinda naughty tonight\n\n(spoken)\nSo there's like a musical interlude uh, before \"I'm feelin' kinda naughty tonight\" and between \"Fly your dirty panties like a kite.\" Okay, second verse!\n\n(sung)\nSorry I said that creepy stuff out loud\nThat was super rando\nI meant to say I wanna do cutesy\u2014\nLike pillow fight or go swimmin' commando\n\nI wanna kill you and wear your skin like a dress\nBut then also have you see me in the dress\nAnd be like, \"O-M-G you look so cute in my skin!\"\n\nI wanna lock you in a basement but in that basement\nYou would also be my personal trainer\n\nBreak into your mom's house, collect your baby teeth\nAnd turn them into my new retainer\n\nCook your pee into a chowder\nDry your poop into a powder\nAnd shoot you up in the night\n\nCause I'm feelin' kinda naughty\u2014\nTake measurements of your body\nThen go up to a surgeon\nMake my body like your body\nLike that film with Liberace\u2014\n'Cause I'm feelin' kinda naughty tonight", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78c454c10511f429b7d861cf55e81e0c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
