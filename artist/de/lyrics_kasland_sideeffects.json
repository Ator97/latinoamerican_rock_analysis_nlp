Only on the week days\nAnd I never thought about it\nBut I shout at everybody then my angers automatic\nLike I barely get upset and I just lose control\nStop asking me to change before I lose it, oh\nAnd you don't want to run up into someone in the place so\nWell equipped with hellish shit and mentally erased, no-\n-Body ever saw me \u2019til I caught up with the pace though\nNow you want to say that you're a fan, if you say so\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nPeople all talk, but it's all the same\nThey think they know me cause they know my name\nHalf the shit they say drives me so insane\nImma snap one day and you're all to blame\nNow pause the game, buy some X\nStart sipping on a 40 while you drive and text\nAll insanity, profanity, the lies are next\nI'm just mentally insane and these are side effects\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Tin]\nYeah, I'm crazy, don't fuck with me\nTired of dealing with these hoes\nFucking sick of y'all bugging me\nBefore these side effects explode (go and get it, mother fucker)\nTell me why you stupid bitches got to ask when I pass\nWhy can't Lil Tin just holler back, God, he's mad\nNow I'm mad, I'm just barely sticking it out\nInstead of my name we'll put my dick in your mouth\nSay fuck you, fuck you, fuck you all\nOh this shit's a fucking game, what? You busting my balls\nMan, this ain't the fucking card that you're wanting to draw\nYou're the reason why I cuss so fucking much in this song\nI said now I'm getting really pissed off, add my withdraws\nAnger's about to lift off, peaking to the tip top\nGet off, I'm jumping like a tip off\nSick of all this shit, middle finger's up for lift off\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nPeople all talk, but it's all the same\nThey think they know me cause they know my name\nHalf the shit they say drives me so insane\nImma snap one day and you're all to blame\nNow pause the game, buy some X\nStart sipping on a 40 while you drive and text\nAll insanity, profanity, the lies are next\nI'm just mentally insane and these are side effects\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nPeople all talk, but it's all the same\nThey think they know me cause they know my name\nHalf the shit they say drives me so insane\nImma snap one day and you're all to blame\nNow pause the game, buy some X\nStart sipping on a 40 while you drive and text\nAll insanity, profanity, the lies are next\nI'm just mentally insane and these are side effects\n\n[Outro: Claas]\nYeah, Kasland, horns up, it\u2019s Texas, you know what it is\nWe going insane in this mother fucker\nWe ain\u2019t never going to be normal\nThis is underground rap music, what you know about that\nLet\u2019s go, that\u2019s the motto, TCH", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
