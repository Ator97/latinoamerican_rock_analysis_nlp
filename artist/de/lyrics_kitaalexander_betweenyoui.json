Don't you know?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know the hardest love you'll ever find, between you & I\nWell we've been wounded by a great divide, it's just human nature\nYou know there'll never be a lonely day, if it's you and I\nIt's taking everything to realize, it's just human nature\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow you holdin' on to life\nLosin' track of time\nFadin' out the light on us\nI'll show you how you can believe\nJust loosen up your feelings\nDancin' down the street with me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThrough the jungle, I swear I'll take you\nThe tears belong to human nature\nSome reflects our bad behavior\nDon't you know? Don't you know?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know the hardest love you'll ever find, between you & I\nWell we've been wounded by a great divide, it's just human nature\nYou know there'll never be a lonely day, if it's you and I\nIt's taking everything to realize, it's just human nature\n\n[Bridge]\nYou know the hardest love lies, between you and I\nYou know the greatest love lies, in the great divide\nYou know the hardest love lies, between you and I\nYou know the greatest love lies\nDon't you know? Don't you know?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou know the hardest love you'll ever find, between you & I\nWell we've been wounded by a great divide, it's just human nature\nYou know there'll never be a lonely day, if it's you and I\nIt's taking everything to realize, it's just human nature\n\n[Outro]\nIt's just human nature, human nature\nHuman nature, human nature\nIt's just human nature, oh woah, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c1ae4d15046e3d15461487bdc2e5115a.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kita Alexander"}
