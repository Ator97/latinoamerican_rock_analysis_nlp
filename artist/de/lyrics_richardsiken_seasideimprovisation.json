The yard is dark, the tomatoes are next to the whitewashed wall,\nthe book on the table is about Spain,\nthe windows are painted shut.\nTonight you're thinking of cities under crowns\nof snow and I stare at you like I'm looking through a window,\ncounting birds.\nYou wanted happiness, I can't blame you for that,\nand maybe a mouth sounds idiotic when it blathers on about joy but tell me\nyou love this, tell me you're not miserable.\nYou do the math, you expect the trouble.\nThe seaside town. The electric fence.\nDraw a circle with a piece of chalk. Imagine standing in a constant cone\nof light. Imagine surrender. Imagine being useless. A stone on the path means the tea's not ready,\na stone in the hand means somebody's angry, the stone inside you still hasn't hit bottom.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
