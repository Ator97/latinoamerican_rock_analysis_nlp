Where are you?\n\nIf I have it all\nWhy do I feel so small?\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\n\nIf I have it all\nWhy do I feel so small?\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\n\nShe that takes me somewhere\nSomewhere I can't go alone\nBut I get lost and wonder\nWhy I feel, I don't belong\n\nBut I'm need of knowing\nIf so much love\nIs good enough\n\nAnd I've been missing something\nWhere are you? Where are you?\n\nIf I have it all\nWhy do I feel so small?\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\n\nIf I have it all\nWhy do I feel so small?\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\n\nShe keeps me strong\nShe carries me on\nBut voices say she's wrong\nShe makes me fight\nWhat's in my mind\nMy voices keep me blind\nIf I have it all\nWhy do I feel so small\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\nIf I have it all\nWhy do I feel so small?\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud\nI try to hold my demons\nBut they scream too loud", "image": "https://images.genius.com/c9ac52bad2e3645c8b102bdec2ef8c92.630x630x1.jpg"}], "artist": "We The Lion"}
