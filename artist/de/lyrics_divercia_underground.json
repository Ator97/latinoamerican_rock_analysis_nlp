(That day he struck a nerve.)\nAnd claim the throne by falling down to hell, 5 miles south of heaven...\n\nNow they want to be on his side again\nHe has come to claim what belongs to you\nYou don't want to waste your breath on him\nTim rules the throne, a time for reckoning\n\nAnd now they want to be on his side again\nHe has come to claim the gift that belongs to you\nIt's time for Tim to claim the first prize...\n\nNow his the master of the skies\nAbsolute power gone wrong\nYou don't want to waste your breath on him\nTim rules the throne, a time for reckoning\n\nNow they want to be on his side again\nHe has come to claim what belongs to you\nYou don't want to waste your breath on him\nTim rules the throne, a time for reckoning", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7a0e3712d23c45d5ddc570bc8a788674.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Divercia"}
