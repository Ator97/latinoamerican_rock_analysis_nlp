Lara\nSolo D. Ortiz\nSolo J. Lara\nSolo D. Ortiz\n\nThis is what you feel, not what you need\nVoices of madness speak inside you\nWherever you go, is a constant fear\nSearching the help from above", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Sacrilegio"}
