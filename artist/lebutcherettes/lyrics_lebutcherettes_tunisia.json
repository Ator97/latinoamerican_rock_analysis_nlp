Can you not glow?!?!?!?!?!\n\n\u2026Yet I was a cruisin\u2019\nLooking for my choosin\u2019\nDo\u2019h, do\u2019h, do\u2019h\n\nThought I\u2019ve seen all of it\n\nGuess we\u2019re just a small part of it all\n\nThought I\u2019ve seen all of it\nGuess I\u2019m not worth half of it\nThought I\u2019ve seen all of it\nGuess we\u2019re just a small part of it all", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7e5705ba8a318843ceae9a3a715dd541.320x320x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Le Butcherettes"}
