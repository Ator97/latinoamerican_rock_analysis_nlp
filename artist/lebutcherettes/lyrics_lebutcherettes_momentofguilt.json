The good, the bad, the ones you think\nWould be impervious to my persuasions, and I've reduced them to\nMere shell of themselves\nI take the very strong, the heroic, the weak and the despicable alike\nI invade their every thought and movement\nTheir marriages fail, they become depressed, despondent\nSome of them are unable to hold on\nBut most come out better.\"\n\nI asked, \"How could that be? How could anyone become better by\nHaving been put through so much pain?\n\nGuilt said, \"I make them see themselves for what they are.\"\n\nI asked, \"Whats the point?\"\n\nGuilt said, \"THat's the problem I'm having, I've come to hate myself, I hate what I do.  I feel awful.\"\n\n\"So, youre feeling the wrath of god?\" I asked\n\nGuilt looked at the ground and nodded\nGuilt then looked up and said, I can't get to you, I've tried and tried.  Nothing seems to work.\"\n\n\"What do you think that is?\", I asked\n\nGuilt answered, \" Because you're a monster.\"\n\nI said \"It took you this long to figure that out?\"", "image": "https://images.genius.com/5e9de61790b2eaec7e3e1478c369efe0.700x715x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Le Butcherettes"}
