How could I turn myself from the light?\nHow could I? How could I?\nThe damn truth is, it's just too bright\n\n[Chorus]\nI saw the shiny thing\nIt washed up rising, but who knows?\nAnd then the rooftop fell to the ghouls\nThe second it drowned\n\n[Outro]\nHa, ha, ha, ahh\nHa, ha, ha, ahh\nBut who knows?\nHa, ha, ha, ahh\nHa, ha, ha, ahh\nIt drowned", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f11e2001729d975eee6482aaf0a8a2b8.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Le Butcherettes"}
