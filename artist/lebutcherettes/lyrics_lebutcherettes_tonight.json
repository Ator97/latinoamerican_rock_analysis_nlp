Tonight!\n\nAll he needs is a piece of you and me, honey\nAll he needs is a taste of greed, tonight honey\n\nTonight, honey\nIn my mouth, in my thigh\nIn my rib, in my backside\nIn the middle of my sleep...\nTonight! Tonight!\n\nTonight, honey\nIn my mouth, in my thigh\nIn my rib, in my backside\nIn the middle of my sleep\nAll you wanna fucking do\nIs rip right through\nIs rip right through\nTonight, night, night\nNight, night, night, night!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fb528634c300a4c86b39ceac6fa74596.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Le Butcherettes"}
