I don't know\nWe'll never understand\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll of the reasonings of your reactions\nYour mind has gotten strange\nI thought I gave you everything but trouble\nEven to this day\n\n[Bridge]\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nNo room for drama\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la\nNo need for drama\n\n[Verse 4]\nI lived with you a life time\nAnd never would I have suspected\nHow fickle you have made me\nDropped my friends like hot potatoes\n\n[Chorus]\nWon't you go and leave me now?\nWhy won't you go and leave me now?\nWhy won't you go and leave me now?\nWhy don't you go and leave me now?\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f11e2001729d975eee6482aaf0a8a2b8.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Le Butcherettes"}
