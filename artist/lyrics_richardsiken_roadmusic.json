You want to see the future but you only see the sky. Fluffy clouds.\nLook\u2014white fluffy clouds. Looking back is easy for a while and then looking back gets\nmurky. There is the road, and there is the story of where the road goes, and then more road,\nthe roar of the freeway, the roar of the city sheening across the city. There should be a place.\nAt the rest stop, in the restaurant, the overpass, the water's edge . . .\n\n\n2\nHe was not dead yet, not exactly\u2014\nparts of him were dead already, certainly other parts were still only waiting\nfor something to happen, something grand, but it isn't\nalways about me, he keeps saying, though he's talking about the only heart he knows\u2014\nHe could build a city. Has a certain capacity. There's a niche in his chest where a heart would fit perfectly\nand he thinks if he could just maneuver one into place\u2014\nwell then, game over.\n\n\n3\nYou wonder what he's thinking when he shivers like that.\nWhat can you tell me, what could you possibly tell me? Sure, it's good to feel things, and if it hurts, we're doing it\nto ourselves, or so the saying goes, but there should be\na different music here. There should be just one safe place\nin the world, I mean\nthis world. People get hurt here. People fall down and stay down and I don't like the way the song goes.\nYou, the moon. You, the road. You, the little flowers\nby the side of the road. You keep singing along to that song I hate. Stop singing.", "image": "https://images.genius.com/045213729c2849c91bd31691d50139e2.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Richard Siken"}
