How long?\nThese walls are so thin, I keep my secrets in\nBut when I took the walls apart, I didn't mean to break\nYour heart\nYou said you've tried everything to get in my head\nAnd you said, how long, when you open up your eyes to\nThe sun, will rain come?\nDon't leave me on my own in this gossip ridden town\nDon't leave me all alone spinning endlessly around\nYou wish I would let you in, well let me let you in\nI let you under my skin, just let me let you in\nYou wish I would let you in, well let me let you in\nI let you under my skin, just let me let you in\nYou said that you're scared of every step that you\nTread\nAnd you said, like me everything is not what it may\nSeem\nHow long until you leave me all alone, with my fences\nFallin' down?\nI'll be screaming on my own in this gossip ridden town\nYou wish I would let you in, well let me let you in\nI let you under my skin, just let me let you in\nYou wish I would let you in, well let me let you in\nI let you under my skin, just let me let you in\nYou said that!\nYou wish I would let you in, well let me let you in\nI let you under my skin, just let me let you in\nYou wish I would let you in, well let me let you in\nI let you under my skin, just let me let you in", "image": "https://images.genius.com/3125507eded134baca88bbc9e6db12ea.512x512x1.png"}], "artist": "Chikita Violenta"}
