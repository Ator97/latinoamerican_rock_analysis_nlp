You've got me undercover\nAm I your only lover?\n\nAnother heartbreak on the way\nAnother heart breaks 'cause you play\nI need to get up, get out, get going\nYour breeze is blowing me away\nYour breeze is blowing me away\n\nLast night I swung by your place\nTo see if your light was on\nI'm scared, I'm so scared\nBaby I'm so scared!\nTell me... Are you moving on?\nOh no!\nDid you find someone new baby?\nTell me that it's not true\n\nAnother heartbreak on the way\nAnother heart breaks 'cause you play\nI need to get up, get out, get going\nYour breeze is blowing me away\nYour breeze is blowing me away\n\nYour breeze is blowing...\nYour breeze is blowing me away\nYour breeze is blowing me away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/98741cd44382b2e32ab4addad69a54b1.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Viniloversus"}
