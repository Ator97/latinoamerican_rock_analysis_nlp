It's everything, it's something you can't hide\nWhat is love? Is it the way you look into my eyes?\nWhat is love? The things you do that take me by surprise\n\n(Chorus)\nAmor is to love you, amor is to care\nAmor is to people with something to share\nAmor for the Spanish, amor for the French\nLove in any language always means the same\n\nWhat is love? Is it the joy of having you around?\nWhat is love? Is it the way you lift me when I'm down?\nWhat is love? Is it a dream no one can't do without?\nWhat is love? It's in the words that I'm singing out\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWhat is love? La no Brasil se fala da curtir\nWhat is love? Dir en Francais ma petit cherie\nWhat is love? Es la emoci\u00f3n que despiertas en mi\nWhat is love? Around the world, they all know what it means\n\n(Chorus)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/61346f551180d36f259823c7d47c6aa7.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Los Amigos Invisibles"}
