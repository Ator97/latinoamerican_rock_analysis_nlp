Lo, see how the vanished years\nIn robes outworn lean over heaven's rim\nAnd from the water, smiling through her tears\nRemorse arises, and the sun grows dim\nAnd in the east, her long shroud trailing light\nList, O my grief, the gentle steps of Night", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Sabaoth"}
