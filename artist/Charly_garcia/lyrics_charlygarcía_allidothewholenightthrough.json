Sky's are blue!\nMorning, noon, and night-time, too!\nAll I do the whole day through\nIs dream of you-o-u!\n\nIt's the cat's meow!\n\nAll I do the whole day through\nIs dream of You", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d8e2868e61f76c4dee86d2a5da5d30a8.719x719x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Charly Garc\u00eda"}
