Smoke a little tree\nSet us on fire, coulda set us all free\nShawty take a trip with me\nSearching for the truth, i dont know where it's gon' be\nCan it be the water? Smoke a little tree\nSet us on fire, will it set us all free?\n\n[Verse: Renzilla]\nLet's take a trip and let's go\nTo find yourself and your soul\nForget you worries, let go\nI know your scared but don't woe\nThe water's fine so i dove\nI feel the drugs and i'm slowed\nMy foreign chick, she miss home\nBut she ain't tryna go home\nAfter the top, i'ma get it\nI did some things, I regret it\nBut you weren't there for the notion\nSo dont talk like you know shit, yeah\nKeepin' improvin' your body and mind\nRead on my aurora, my chakras aligned\nLive for the present we get from the time, yeah\nCatch me rollin' all my pain up so im never feeling, yeah\nAll these thoughts up in my brain got me feelin' different, whoa\nI be honest all the time but you could never listen, yeah\nFeel a way and I can never stop it and never know it, yeah\nNow you calling, \"yeah?\"\nFalling down like, \"yeah!\"\nI be gone all year\n\n[Hook: Andr\u00e9 Wander & Renzilla]\nCome and take a trip with me\nSearching for the truth, i dont know where it's gon' be\nCan it be the water? Smoke a little tree\nSet us on fire, coulda set us all free\nShawty take a trip with me\nSearching for the truth, i dont know where it's gon' be\nCan it be the water? Smoke a little tree\nSet us on fire, will it set us all free?\n\n[Outro]\nZilla", "image": "https://images.genius.com/0d34fe865efe2a976403740fa9683ad6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Renzilla"}
