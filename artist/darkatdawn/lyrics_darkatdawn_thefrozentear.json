What do I wait for?\nJust her eyes to look at?\nWhat do I wait for? What do I wait for now?\n\nBehold those inner mysteries\nNo back and forth, no step to left nor to right\nYou don't know what this gift means\nI laid down by your side\nReceived this winter's night\n\nChorus 2\nTurning back once again\nWhat do I wait for? What do I wait for?\nJust forget to give in?\nWhat do I wait for? What do I wait for now?\n\nA golden dawn appears\nShe flies by my side\nAnd leaves a frozen tear\n...but just dreams in the night\n\nChorus 2\n\nStaring to the secret in the west\nWhere to lay my weary head to rest...", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Dark At Dawn"}
