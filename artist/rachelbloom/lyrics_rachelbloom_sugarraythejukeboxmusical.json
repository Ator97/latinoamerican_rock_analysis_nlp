I do many interesting, druggy things. I guess you could say is, my life philosophy is:\n\nI\nJust wanna fly\n\n(runs to Jeffrey)\n\nPut your arms around me, baby!\nPut your arms around me, baby!\n\n(They put their arms around each other)\n\n'Cause\n\n[JEFFREY AND PHOENIX]\nI\nJust want\nTo fly\n\n[PHOENIX]\n(in a mock-Jamaican accent)\nSpread your love and fly!\nSpread your love and fly!\n\n[JEFFREY]\n(mimics Phoenix)\nSpread your love and fly!\nSpread your love and fly!\n\n[JEFFREY AND PHOENIX]\nSpread your love and fly!\nSpread your love and fly...\n\n(They make out)\n\n\nSCENE TWO\n\n[JEFFREY]\n(to the audience)\nPhoenix was everything I needed, but didn't know I needed. Impulsive. Passionate. Two interesting names. We spent three blissful weeks doing nothing but making love and talking about our mutual hatred of Smash Mouth.\n\nEverything was great... until the day that everything went wrong.\n\n[PHOENIX]\nCome with me, Jeffrey.\n\n[JEFFREY]\nPhoenix, where are you taking me? This is the bad part of town, it creeps me out...\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nShut the door, baby\nDon't say a word\n\n[PHOENIX]\nI'm taking you to a party.\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nShut the door, baby\nDon't say a word\n\n(They arrive at the club)\n\n[PHOENIX]\nHere we are!\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nShut the door, baby\nShut the door, baby\nShut the door, baby\n\n[PHOENIX]\nJeffrey, shut the door, it's cold, there's a draft.\n\n[JEFFREY]\nYeah, yeah.\n\n(shuts the door)\n\nPhoenix, what is this place? It's dark and it smells like sex.\n\n[PHOENIX]\nWelcome to... a drug party!\n\nIt's a party where we do drugs - illegal drugs! Hahaha!\n\n[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #1]\nSometimes,\nI just want to be left alone\n\n[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #2]\nMove your big head\nIt's my way - go and get your own\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\n(as they close in threateningly around Jeffrey)\nI don't care about the things you do\nI don't care about the things you do\nI don't care about the things you do\nI don't care about\nI don't care about\n\nAll my friends\nCan't relate!\nNo time out\nTo hesitate\nTo my head\n\n(Mime taking drugs)\n\nTouch my face\nTwo steps back\n\n(Mime shooting drugs into their butt cracks)\n\nYou're in my space!\n\n(They groan contentedly)\n\n[JEFFREY]\n(to the audience)\nI love that song. It's a very underrated track off the album \"14:59\"!\n\nPhoenix, did those people all just shoot heroine into their butt cracks?\n\n[PHOENIX]\nYeah! Shooting heroine into your butt gets the drugs into the stream quicker - the blood... stream, that is!\n\n[JEFFREY]\nPhoenix, you're in too deep with this crowd! Let me help you! I can take you to a place or somewhere where they can get you clean!\n\n[PHOENIX]\nNo, no! You just can't handle it! 'Cause my 'tude is so hot... I might as well be walking on the sun!\n\nIt ain't no joke-\n\n[JEFFREY]\n(suddenly)\nNO! NO! NO!!!\n\nWalking on the sun?! How could you say such a STUPID thing?! IT'S A STUPID METAPHOR AND IT DOESN'T HOLD UP!!!\n\nYou have a drug problem that needs to be addressed! Let me help you!\n\n[PHOENIX]\nFuck you, I'm going back into the club!\n\n[JEFFREY]\nNo!\n\n(They struggle)\n\n(Phoenix starts weeping)\n\n[JEFFREY]\nShe falls apart\nBy herself\nNo one's there to talk or understand\nFeels the sting\nDries her eyes\nFinds herself\nOpens the door and\n\n[PHOENIX]\nRunaway, runaway\n\n[JEFFREY]\nRunaway, runaway\n\n[PHOENIX]\nHold\n\n[JEFFREY]\nOn\n\n[PHOENIX]\nYou\n\n[JEFFREY]\nTomorrow\n\n[JEFFREY AND PHOENIX]\nBut you're leaving today\n\n[PHOENIX]\nRunaway, runaway\n\n[JEFFREY]\nRunaway, runaway!\n\n[PHOENIX]\nHold\n\n[JEFFREY]\nOn\n\n[PHOENIX]\nYou\n\n[JEFFREY]\nTomorrow\n\n[JEFFREY AND PHOENIX]\nBut you're leaving today...\n\n[JEFFREY]\nSo you really won't come away with me?\n\n[PHOENIX]\nNo.\n\n[JEFFREY]\nWow.\n\nYou really just Smash Mouth'd my heart.\n\nAnd by that I mean you ruined it.\n\nLike Smash Mouth ruined music...\n\n[PHOENIX]\nRunaway, runaway\n\n[JEFFREY]\nRunaway, runaway\n\n[PHOENIX]\nHold on you tomorrow\nBut I'm leaving today\nBut I'm leaving today\n\n(takes out heroine needle)\n\nBut I'm dying\n\n(injects heroine into her butt crack)\n\nToday...\n\n(Phoenix slowly collapses into a heap)\n\n(The ensemble gathers around, upset)\n\n[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #3]\nStarstreak and/or Phoenix!\n\n[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #1]\nGuys, I think she overdosed on butt heroine.\n\n[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #2]\nAnd also, she had AIDS the whole time!\n\n(gasps of shock)\n\n(Jeffrey runs in)\n\n[JEFFREY]\nNo, it can't be true! She can't be dying!\n\n(Enter a drag queen, Butterfly)\n\n[BUTTERFLY]\nIt is true!\n\nI found her in the park, huddled under a tree!\n\n[JEFFREY]\nThank you for bringing her to me, Butterfly. You've been an integral part of this story that no one will ever forget.\n\n[BUTTERFLY]\nI know! I left my butterfly wings a long time ago! Now my character arc is complete! Okay?\n\n(As Jeffrey holds Phoenix in his arms:)\n\n[JEFFREY]\nSomeday\nWhen my life has passed me by\nI'll lie around and wonder why\nYou were always there\nFor me\n\n[BUTTERFLY]\n(highly emotive)\nOne word\nIn the eyes of a passerby\nI'll look around for another truth\nAnd I'll fade away...\n\n(Phoenix slowly rises from the floor - now an angel, saying goodbye to Jeffrey)\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nJust close your eyes, and I'll take you there\nThis place is warm without a care\nTake a swim in the deep blue sea\nI go to leave as you reach\nFor\nMe\n\n(The ensemble gathers in the same line from the show's beginning)\n\nEvery morning, there's a halo hanging from the corner\nOf my girlfriend's four-post bed\n\n[BUTTERFLY]\nFour-post bed!\n\n[ENSEMBLE]\nI know it's not mine\nBut I'll see if I can use it\n\nFive hundred twenty-five thousand minutes\n\nSmash\nMouth\nSucks!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/92b9912d8af4b4baa1e545c81facaac4.605x605x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
