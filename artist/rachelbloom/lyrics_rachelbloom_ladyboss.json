'Cause bein' a boss is empowering!\nHuh! But it's also kinda weird\nHuh! So this is how it feels to be a hashtag ladyboss!\nLa-la-ladyboss! La-la-ladyboss!\n\n[Chorus - RACHEL]\nI want you to do what I want, but let me say it in a nice way\nOh right, I shouldn't care if you think I'm nice\nDo you think I'm a bitch? Well, I don't give a shit!\nBut if I do give a shit, does that make me weak?\nLadyboss!\n\n[Verse 1 - RACHEL]\nLa-la-ladyboss tips!\nTake big swings and suppress the fear of catastrophic failure\nOther women aren't a threat, but some see you as a threat, like, \"What did I do to you, Taylor?\"\nDemand a raise and don't say \"I know other people could do my job\"\nGet a Ruth Bader Ginsburg pillow for your office to muffle the sound of sobs\nHuh!\n(Sobbing)\n[BOSS]\nRachel, we need you in the meeting\n[RACHEL]\nComing!\n\n[Verse 2 - RACHEL]\nI want you to do what I want, but let me say it in a nice way\nOh right, I shouldn't care if you think I'm nice\nDo you think I'm a bitch? Well, I don't give a shit!\nBut if I do give a shit, is that internalized misogyny?\nIs it?\n[DEREK]\nI have some very useful thoughts on this\n[RACHEL]\nNot now, Derek!\n[FEMALE COLLEAGUES]\nUgh!\n\n[Verse 3 - RACHEL]\nAnd how much boob is too much boob?\nHow much boob is too much boob?\nOn my deathbed I'll still be asking...\n[OLD RACHEL]\nHow much boob is too much boob?\n[RACHEL'S DAUGHTER]\nWhere's the money? WHERE'S THE MONEY, YOU OLD BITCH!?\n\n[Chorus - RACHEL]\nI want you to do what I want, but let me say it in a nice way\nOh right, I shouldn't care if you think I'm nice\nDo you think I'm a bitch? Well, I don't give a shit!\nBut if I do give a shit-\n\n[Outro (spoken)]\nSeriously, Taylor, what is your problem with me?\n[TAYLOR]\nI don't know. I guess that deep down, I think your success means my failure\n[RACHEL]\nWow, okay. Um, let's talk about that\n[FEMALE COLLEAGUE]\nYeah, fuck the music video!\n[TAYLOR]\nWell, I guess it started in elementary school, when I was being kinda loud, and then this one teacher said, \"Why can't you be quiet, like Jessica?\"\n[DEREK]\nI have some very useful thoughts on this too!\n[RACHEL]\nDerek! Just give us five minutes, okay?\n[DEREK]\nYou got it, boss!\n[RACHEL]\nContinue\n\n[ALL]\nLadyboss!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/92b9912d8af4b4baa1e545c81facaac4.605x605x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
