Uh... temp melody for the intro verse.\u00a0\n\n(sung)\nWhen we're together\nI feel so grand\nMy heart goes tippity-tap-tap-tap\nWhen I hold your hand\nBut I know there's another guy\nYou fancy more\nSo, even though\nI'm not the one you adore\nWhy not...\n\n(spoken)\nAnd I'll go an octave up\u2014\n\n(sung)\nSettle for me\nDarling, just settle for me\nYou have to agree\nWe make quite a pair\nI know I'm second place in this game\nBut like two-percent milk\nOr seitan beef\nI almost taste the same\n\nSettle for me\nCome on and settle for me\nSay yes or no before I choke on all this swallowed pride\nI have no problem being picked out from the bottom\nIf he's your broken condom, I'm Plan B!\nSo lower those expectations and settle for me\n\n'Cause I'm totally okay with this!\n\nSettle for me\nBabycakes, just settle for me\nSchmoopy-pie, can't you see the light?\nCookie\u2014, I'm so bereft\nDemeaning terms are all that I have left\nOf my masculinity\n\nLittle girl\nDon't make me feel like a little girl\nExposed and raw\nWhose boobs can't even fill a training bra\nI don't like where this train of thought is going!\n\nSettle for me\n\u2014I'll settle for you\nSettle for me\n\u2014You're selling past the clothes\nHe\u2019s a fantasy\nThat fact I get\nYeah, Josh is a dream, but I\u2019m right here\nIn flesh and blood and self-hate\nSo settle for me\nIn a sad way, darling, it\u2019s fate\n\n(spoken)\nAnd then there's a dance break. And then in the middle of the dance break, at some point:\n\n(sung)\nI don't expect much sex\n\n(spoken)\nSomething like that, dance break goes on. I wanna do Fred and Ginger dancing mixed with some soft shoe mixed with some real tap dancing. Uh... we stop at a certain point to fart 'cause they're at a taco festival. Okay, so then the dance break continues. Then:\n\n(sung)\nYou're Step Up 2\nSolange to Beyonc\u00e9\nNot asking to be your fianc\u00e9\nJust asking you to consider\nJust for tonight\nOr maybe, for the rest of our lives\n(spoken)\nThat was too much, sorry\u2014\n(sung)\nTo settle for me!\n\n(spoken)\nSomething like that.\u00a0", "image": "https://images.genius.com/78c454c10511f429b7d861cf55e81e0c.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
