It's like a prison cot.\u00a0\n\n[JOSH]\nOn the stove\n\nAnd sort of in the fridge\nOne time I think\n\nThat's where we hit your back pati\u2014\nOh!\n\u00a0\n[GREG]\nOver the sink\n\n\nAnd then we hit the back patio\n\n\nOh!\n[BOTH]\nWe tapped that ass all over this house\n\nHow many times did we tap that behind?\n\n[GREG]\nWell, let's estimate\n\n[JOSH]\nOn an average day, I would have to say\nMmm... a-5, 6, 7, 8!\n\n[GREG, spoken]\nWhat? Too cheeky?\n\n[JOSH, spoken]\nHey, does this ring a bell?\n(sung)\n\"A little to the left...\"\n\n[GREG]\n\"Oh, oh, okay now, a little to the right...\"\n\n[JOSH]\n\"Oh, oh, wait, wait, back to the left...\"\n\n[GREG]\n\"Right there! Right there!\"\n\n[JOSH]\n\"Wait, no, you're doing it wrong! I'll do it myself!\"\n\n[GREG, spoken]\nBarkeep, what's on tap?\n\n[REBECCA, spoken]\nIt's me. And my ass.\u00a0\n\n[GREG, spoken]\nOoh, sounds refreshing!\n\n[JOSH]\nOn the table you were willing and able\n\nAnd on the safe in the closet\nI made a deposit\n\u00a0\n[GREG]\nOn the ottoman\nYou took a lotta man\n[XANDER]\nI also tapped that ass all over this house!\n\n[JOSH, spoken]\nLet's wrap this up with a big finish!\n\n[GREG, spoken]\nBut where should we finish?\n\n[REBECCA, spoken]\nPlease not on my chest... no, you'll scratch it!\n\n\u00a0\n[JOSH]\nOn the bathroom floor\n\nYou just wanted more\n\n[GREG]\nOn the accent wall\n\nYou didn't care where\n[BOTH]\nHow much more tappin' could one ass endure?\nWe tapped that ass (tapped that ass)\nWe tapped that ass (tapped that ass)\nWe tapped that ass all over this house!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb888fbca68232c55f54a06acc56ac7d.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
