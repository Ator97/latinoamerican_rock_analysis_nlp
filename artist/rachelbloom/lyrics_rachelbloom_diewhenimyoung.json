WEINBLATT]\n[RACHEL]: Hello?\n[DR. WEINBLATT]: Hi, Rachel, it's Dr. Weinblatt calling with your test results\n[RACHEL]: Oh hey, what's up?\n[DR. WEINBLATT]: I'm afraid to say the biopsy came back positive\n[RACHEL]: What do you mean, positive?\n\n[Chorus - RACHEL]\nI'm gonna die when I'm young\nI didn't expect this to literally happen\nI'm gonna die when I'm young\nI guess this is what I wanted\n\n[Verse 2 - RACHEL]\nBack in the club shakin' my ass\nThen I have to lay down for a while\n(Yeah, lay down!)\nHang with the DJ, spin a coupla tracks\nAnd then I throw up bile\n(Cool!)\nGettin' freaky with a hottie\nAnd we just don't stop\nThe way he's touchin' up my body\nMakes my panties drop\nI say, \"I'm dyin'.\"\nHe says, \"I'm sorry.\"\nI say \"Let's fuck.\"\nHe says, \"I'm sad now.\"\n\n[Chorus - RACHEL]\nGonna die when I'm young\nI should have had my home checked for asbestos\nGonna die when I'm young\nYeah, it was way cooler in theory\n\n[Verse 3 - RACHEL]\nDoctors give me heavy sedatives\nO-M-G, I'm such a stoner!\nHands are feelin' up my body\n'Cause I'm an organ donor\nI'm dyin' young just 'cause I lived too fast\nAlso, I have a tumor\n\n[Rap Break - FETUS]\nYo, y'all think you're so cool for dyin' young? Well, I'm an aborted fetus, motherfucker! I died so young, I didn't even live!\nI'll never go to preschool or the prom\nSo I get bitches hotter than my teenage mom\nI spit rhymes faster than my stem cells heal\nSo let the beat drop like my nuts never will\n\n[Chorus - RACHEL (spoken)]\nDie when I'm young\nOh God, this is terrifying!\nDie when I'm young\nPlease, I take it back!\nDie when I'm young\nI never should have aborted that pimp-ass fetus!\nDie when I'm young\n\n[FETUS]: Shit that bitch is dead!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa35dc9d59755f7b2eb3800dd46af2e0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
