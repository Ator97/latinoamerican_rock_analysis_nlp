I will sue you for invasion of privacy, you fucking insane bitch!\"\n\nNow all I can do is lay around\nAnd post pictures of your dick around your neighborhood like it's a lost puppy\nAll I can do is sit and cry\nNow all I can do is lay around\nAnd write \"Lost Dick. Answers to the name 'Tim's Tiny Dick.'\"\nAll I can do is cry", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa35dc9d59755f7b2eb3800dd46af2e0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
