I have a deceptive amount of\nMuscular strength due to my amazing core\"\n\nPaula calls out from the bathroom\n\"Her little bird arms are not going to do anything.\"\n\nThen I step up and I'm like\n\"I'll try. My second sophomore year I took\nA kinesiology class. That's college for gym\"\n\nNothing happens\n\nThen we all look over at Karen\nThe kinda deranged women who's pretending\nTo be some french chick\nKaren says, \"Sorry Angelique has an epigastric hernia\"\n\n[HEATHER, spoken]\nGross\n\n[HEATHER]\nI've had enough so I say we need\nTo call someone\n\nShe's stuck in the bathroom\nShe's stuck in the bathroom\n\nLet's call 9-1-1\n\nWow I can't believe it took us that long\nTo come up with this most obvious solution\nKind of embarrassing\n\nNow Rebecca jumps and shouts\n\"Yes, yes hang in there Paula\nWe're gonna get you out\"\nAnd she runs over to the phone panicking\n\nMeanwhile, Paula's still stuck in the bathroom\n\n[REBECCA, spoken]\nShhh...I'm on the phone!\n\n[HEATHER, spoken]\nSorry", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eb888fbca68232c55f54a06acc56ac7d.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
