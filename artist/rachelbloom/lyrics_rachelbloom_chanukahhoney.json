I've been to Palm Beach\nOh, by the way, I think our parents have mutual friends\n(The Schachters, do you know them?)\n\nChanukah honey\nYou make puns just like my dad\nSo rad\nYou say \"challah\" like \"holla!\"\nChanukah honey\nSo come and spin my dreidel\n\nYou may think I'm stuffy 'cause I work in finance\nBut my bat mitzvah theme was dance!\nLet me make all your dreams come true\nOh, by the way, you went to camp with my friend's step-cousin\n(Small world!)\n\nChanukah honey\nCan you hear those wedding bells?\nLOL!\nBut seriously, do you want kids?\nChanukah honey\nSo come and kiss my mezuzah tonight\n(I heard you were the beatboxer on your college a cappella group)\nCome and bless my challah tonight\n(I'd love to hear your version of \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\")\nMezuzah is the name for my clit", "image": "https://images.genius.com/39aff8fb29aea8e7700724508d67ca43.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
