You people are terrible!\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nI know we broke up, but do you wanna watch the Tonys this year?\n\n[Ex-boyfriend at door]\nYou fucked my brother\n\n[Rachel Bloom]\nDoes your big-dicked brother wanna watch the Tonys this year?\n\n[spoken]\nWha-? Come on, hey\n\nIt's like if birthdays actually had any meaning\nOr your wedding was written by Stephen Sondheim\nIt's like if your neglect hadn't driven me to your brother\nWith a special performance by the cast of the Lion King\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nI think it's time to ask my mom\n\n[Spoken, on phone]\nTonys?\n\n[Mom on phone]\nNo\n\n[Rachel Bloom]\nEnjoy your nursing home\n\nI'll put a personal ad on Craigslist\n\n[Craigslist shave guy]\nI'll do it if I can watch you shave\n\n[Rachel Bloom]\nI could ask my twin if I hadn't strangled her in the womb\n(Fosse!)\n\n[Megan on phone, spoken]\nHey, it's Megan from high school, I just saw your Facebook post about the Tonys, I would totally love to watch it with you and catch up!\n\n[Rachel Bloom]\nOh, you know what, actually the Tonys were cancelled\n\n[Megan]\nWhat, why?\n\n[Rachel Bloom]\nYeah, Broadway exploded\n\n[Megan]\nOh my God, what do we do?\n\n[Rachel Bloom]\nYeah, there's nothing to do, bye\n\nUgh, Megan is so weird\n\n[Ex-boyfriend]\nWill you get the fuck out of here, Rachel?\n\n[Verse 4]\nWho wants to watch the Tony Awards this year?\nThis guy wants to watch the Tony Awards this year!\nI love the tap!\n\n[Craigslist shave guy]\nMore shaving\n\n[Rebecca Bloom]\nI love the witty banter\nMy friends may be trash\nAnd I may be a sociopath\nBut Tonys, I'll watch you every year", "image": "https://images.genius.com/92b9912d8af4b4baa1e545c81facaac4.605x605x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
