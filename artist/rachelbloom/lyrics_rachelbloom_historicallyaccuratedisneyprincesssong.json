Hello, Jews! You know, I never did ask you: why do you live in the forest? Oh, I see, to hide from people trying to kill you. Well that's very resourceful, my beaky little friends. Tell me: have you ever had a dream that wouldn't come true? Oh, I see, your dream is that people won't want to kill you. Well, that's definitely a dream that won't come true! Oh, goodbye, goodbye! Jews\n\n(Song)\nOh, if I found my prince\nWe'd have a wedding elegant and rare\nWe'd dine on kidney cream and horse vagina\nDrink champagne and torture a bear\n\nOh, if I found my prince\nThe castle would be filled with love and laughter\nAnd he'd fill me with his seed, forcibly and rough\nI'd give birth to a son and then die right after!\n\nI wander through the village seeking answers\nBut love hasn't given me a glimpse!\nIt isn't in this shop or in this cart of baby corpses\nOh, when will I find my prince?\nWhen, hand Jesus?!\nOh, when will I find my prince?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa35dc9d59755f7b2eb3800dd46af2e0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
