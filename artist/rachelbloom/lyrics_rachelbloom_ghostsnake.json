A ghost snake!\nA snake that's a ghost! A ghost that's a snake!\nMost snakes aren't ghost snakes\nBut this one is, it's a motherfuckin' ghost snake!\n\nWhat? What? What is that?\n\"Be scared of me,\" the ghost snake insisted\n\"I'm the most awesome creature that has ever existed\nScales made of ectoplasm, fangs made of screams\nAnd my venom is made of broken dreams\nI'm a ghost snake! A ghost snake!\nA snake that's a ghost! A ghost that's a snake!\nMost snakes aren't ghost snakes\nBut I am, I'm a motherfuckin' ghost snake!\"\n\nHisssss! Boo! Hissssss! Boo! Hissssss! Boo! Hissssss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss! Boo! Hiss!\n\nIt's a ghost snake! A ghost snake!\nA snake that's a ghost! A ghost that's a snake!\nMost snakes aren't ghost snakes\nBut I am, it's a motherfuckin' ghost snake!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa35dc9d59755f7b2eb3800dd46af2e0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
