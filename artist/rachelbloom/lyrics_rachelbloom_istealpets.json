I steal pets from the popular people and then dress the pets up like the popular people\nI steal pets from the popular people\nAnd lock them in my shed\n\nAt school, life can be such a drag\nWhitney Jones called me a fag\nBut her cat ate salmon out of my hand!\nI smiled at Michael in the halls\nThen he spread rumors I have balls\nBut I taught his dog to hug on command!\nI have so many friends!\nRight, dog?!\n\n\u2018Cause I steal pets from the popular people and then dress the pets up like the popular people\nI steal pets from the popular people and hide them all in a shed\nYeah! I steal pets from the popular people and then dress the pets up like the popular people\nI steal pets from the popular people\nAnd paint their nails red- take it Cuddles!\n\nBark bark bark bark bark yeah!\nBark bark bark bark bark yeah!\nBark bark bark bark bark yeah!\nRawrrrrrrr\n\nIt's the seventh grade dance in the shed tonight\nAnd I'm the life of it all\nCats and dogs all groovin' with me\nWe're havin' such a ball\nI start slow dancing with Greg Mendelsson's terrier mix\nHe's wearing a suit and he has Greg's eyes\nSuddenly\nWe kiss!\n\n\u2018Cause I steal pets from the popular people and then dress the pets up like the popular people\nI steal pets from the popular people and hide them all in a shed\nYeah! I steal pets from the popular people and then dress the pets up like the popular people\nI steal pets from the popular people\nMy parents both are dead\nBoo!\n\nI steal pets from the popular people\n(Pets aren't yours, pets are mine)\nThen dress them up like the popular people\n(Pets aren't yours, pets are mine)\nYeah I steal pets from the popular people\n(Pets aren't yours, pets are mine)\nAnd dress them up like the popular people\nAll of them are mine!\n\nI steal pets, I steal pets, lock them in my shed\nI steal peeeeeeeeeeetttttss\nLock them in my shed", "image": "https://images.genius.com/fa35dc9d59755f7b2eb3800dd46af2e0.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Rachel Bloom"}
