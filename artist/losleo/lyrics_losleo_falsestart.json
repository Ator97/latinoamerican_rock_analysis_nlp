Can we go to the start again?\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\n\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\nWe were too young for true love, way too guarded\nBut it's not race, so much has changed\nWhat do you see? Can we go to the start again?\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\n\n[Verse 3]\nStill can't accept the way it ended\nI told your best friend I'd have mended\nTyped you a message but can't send it\nIt'd cause problems, but I kinda want them\n\n[Chorus]\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\nWe were too young for true love, way too guarded\nBut it's not race, so much has changed\nWhat do you see? Can we go to the start again?\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I could turn back time\nCould I change your mind?\nPick it up from where we left off\nMake up for everything that we lost\nIf we could turn back time\nCould I change your mind?\nTime is up, just rearrange it\nI know to which ends\n\n[Chorus]\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\nWe were too young for true love, way too guarded\nBut it's not race, so much has changed\nWhat do you see? Can we go to the start again?\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\n\n[Outro]\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started (If I'm honest, I miss our problems)\nWe were too young for true love, way too guarded (But I kind of want them)\nBut it's not race, so much has changed\nWhat do you see? Can we go to the start again?\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started\nNo it wasn't a breakup (It'd cause problems)\nWe false-started (But I kind of want them)\nWe were too young for true love, way too guarded (Do you think I'm mean?)\nBut it's not race, so much has changed\nWhat do you see? Can we go to the start again?\nNo it wasn't a breakup, we false-started", "image": "https://images.genius.com/719e63fe47b8801bd68cd8d0476d6982.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "LOS LEO"}
