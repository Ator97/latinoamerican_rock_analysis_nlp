Cause there's a method to my madness\nA mechanical animal and you'll never understand it\nStranded on this planet ever since the day I landed\nSo take me to your leader, I'm not askin' I'm demandin' it\nBitch!", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1335459428_1003849-traphik08-617-409.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
