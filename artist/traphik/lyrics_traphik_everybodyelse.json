Well, hi my name is Tim\nAgain my name is Tim, fuck everybody else\nCause when the lights is dim, I make your body melt\nSee how your body felt, it will never feel the same\nCause everybody else is a motherfucking lame\n\n[Hook: T-Pain]", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1335459428_1003849-traphik08-617-409.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
