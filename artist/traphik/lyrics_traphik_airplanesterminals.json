Yeah, we on the map\nHow my boys doing? Oh they talking back?\nI kicked my feet up on this fame, can't get lost in that\nBut it's easy when there's money fallin' on your lap\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2: Andrew Garcia]\nIts kinda crazy how the game is changed\nThe lights go on, they scream my name\nThe curtains go down I remain the same\n(But all this money don't equal the price of fame)\nFrom LA to NY, Seattle to the Bay\nOvernight flights to Oahu gettin' laid\nGamble down in Vegas, they know where we stay\nLast show in Cali heading down to the Staples\nNow we...\n\n[Verse 3: Traphik]\nI was a boy with a dream, had my head in the clouds\nNow I\u2019m sleeping first class, got a bed in the clouds\nHit my pops to pick me up and he said he was proud\nKing shit with a bernie on, instead of a crown\nYeah, counting all my blessings, shoutout to the most high\nStarted from the bottom, now I\u2019m sitting at the most high\nCheapies to the busniess, now I\u2019m litrally so fly\nMotivated by my broke-ness, guess that\u2019s why they call it [?]\nBack when I was broke I was asking why I\nGo through all this trouble, wipe the tears up out my eye\nConnected to my fans like we all up on that WI-FI\nThey say the sky's the limit, I\u2019m just starting and I\u2019m sky high\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/7464c590812fe78a9a42dabc86a0f730.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
