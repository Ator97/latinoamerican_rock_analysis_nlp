Shorty can I take you to the movies?\nI was on Egotastic stretching my elastic, seeing you in that red two-piece\nSee my heart just flutters at every word you uttered at every time you started to sing\nAnd eff a Jo Bro cause Jo don't know what he got with his purity ring\nAnd Taylor may be buff but he ain't so tough cause he can't but it down like me\nYou're just so beautiful form your head to your toe and you do it so naturally. Yeah\n\n[Hook: Traphik]\nSelena\nVen aqu\u00ed mami\nTe amo\nYea", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1335459428_1003849-traphik08-617-409.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
