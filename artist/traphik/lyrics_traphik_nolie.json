I told 'em I don't need one\nI make more money than signed cats\nYour views, ten times that\nGot groupies, show they boobies\nAnd ask me, can I sign that\nAll day I dream about sex Adidas\nThen all night I pray 'cuz I'm blessed, Lawd Jesus\nThey say that I'm cheesy 'cuz I'm so facetious\nBut the world is so evil, I know that they need this\nSo tell me you love me, and fuck you if you don't feel me\nI'mma do me, and keep on, till I blow or somebody kill me\n\n[Hook: Drake]\nI say fuck you, less I\u2019m with you\nIf I take you out of the picture\nI know real niggas won't miss you\nNo lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i\nNo lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i\nReal niggas say word\nYou ain't never told no lie\nYou ain't never told no lie\nReal niggas say word\nYou ain't never told no lie\nYou ain't never told no lie\nReal niggas say true\nYou ain't never told no lie\nYou ain't never told no lie\nThat's a thing I don\u2019t do\nNah I just do it for the niggas\nThat are tryna see a million fore they die\nWattup", "image": "https://images.genius.com/17c6ec9b09899fc10af747d207926789.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
