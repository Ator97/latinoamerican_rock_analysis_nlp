Go ahead and hate me then\nIm an alien- no homosapien\nMaking hits- more flavor than some bacon bits\nFlow so official like a Facebook relationship\nThey used to say Tim, why you act so black\nWhat you tryna' rap for, why your raps so whack\nNow they wanna shake hands, but you get no daps\nWalk into the room and they all start a slow clap", "image": "https://images.genius.com/17c6ec9b09899fc10af747d207926789.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
