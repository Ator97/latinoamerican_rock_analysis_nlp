Uh!\n\n[Verse]\nYou got a problem? you should tell me what the problem is\nOr I could puff ya lip up like injecting you with colleging\nYou haters always say my name and keep acknowledging\nSo take my dick up out ya mouth and let ya momma polish it\nYa momma smelling like some kaka with chewbacca lips\nI told her not to talk and put my cock in her esophagus\nShe started coughin spit my dick out on some llama shit\nI told her sorry baby, life is like a box of chocolates\nSo gimme any beat believe I can demolish it\n'Cuz Timothy's unbeatable there ain't no people stopping it\nMy prerogative is spreading out the positive\nBecause honest to God I just got a lotta love to give\nSpeaking to Jesus wit my own telekinesis\nI don't need to hear ya thesis on no demons and demonic shit\nI just wanna rock it to Wockaflocka\nWhile I watch Barack Obama walk us out to the Apocalypse\n\n[Outro]\nAhh, bith!\nYeah! One take!\nHahaha...", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1335459428_1003849-traphik08-617-409.jpg"}], "artist": "Traphik"}
