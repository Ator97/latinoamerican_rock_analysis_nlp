Soon\n\nMornings we have toast and tea\nI gaze across the table, she glares right back at me\nAnd when we're getting low on jam\nI give her the last spoonful, that's just the way I am\nAnd I drive her to work each day\nEven though it's early and work is far away\nAnd I don't even say a thing\nWhen she plays the radio so loud you cannot think\n\n[Chorus:]\nI can't stand her goddamned friends\nBut I will tolerate them, even though I hate them\nAnd I will put up with her parents\n'cause she says I'll not meet someone who is so kind and sweet\nEver again...\n\n[Chorus:]\nI've all my wisdom teeth\nTwo up top, two beneath\nAnd yet I'll recognise\nMy mouth says things that aren't so wise\nBut when I sing my darling's praise\nI know I'm right, or close anyways\nFor she's a gem upon this earth\nI know to me she will return\n\n[Chorus:]\nYeah she'll be coming back...
