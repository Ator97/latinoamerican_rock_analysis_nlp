No one could ever see me\nSeems your the only one who knows what it's like to be me\nSomeone to face the day with\nMake it through all the mess with\nSomeone I'll always laugh with\nEven at my worst, I'm best with\nYou - yeah\nIt's like you're always stuck in second gear\nWhen it hasn't been your day, your week, your month\nOr even your year, but\nI'll be there for you\nWhen the rain starts to pour\nI'll be there for you\nLike I've been there before\nI'll be there for you\n'Cause you're there for me too", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8680cc779463d59bcd2a1eb174c31e98.634x640x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Crash Test Dummies"}
