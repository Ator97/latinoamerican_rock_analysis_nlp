Yes it's beautiful\n\nOur glasses, never just half full\nThe flowers vivid, colorful\nAnd though we feel\nThe push and the pull\nAnd it's beautiful...\nYes it's beautiful\n\nAnd through our hearts are in the right place\nAnd out there is the whole human race\nAnd each one has a mask, and a face\nAnd it's beautiful...\n\nEnough about the look in your eyes\nEnough about the sun and the sky\nIt will always be just you and I\nAnd it's beautiful...\nYes it's beautiful", "image": "https://images.genius.com/da1de4e9849c1b5e0e9d00faf4fa5ae6.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Crash Test Dummies"}
