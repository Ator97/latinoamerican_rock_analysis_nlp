I'm very confused\nI think I'd better have a little something\nI think I'd like to have a little something\n\nThough you probably forget\nThere's a place that we met\nWhen we first started lying at night\nIt was good on the car\nYou would go pretty far\nAnd you seemed like you wanted a fight\n\nCould I please be excused? I'm very confused\nI think I'd better have a little something\nI think I'd like to have a little something\nI think I'd better have a little something\nI think I'd like to have a little something\n\nThere's a star in the sky\nIt's caught my eye\nAnd I'm sure that I've seen it before\nIt was quite long ago\nAnd we stood on the snow\nBut I can't recall where anymore\n\nCould I please be excused? I'm very confused\nI think I'd better have a little something\nI think I'd like to have a little something\nI think I'd better have a little something\nI think I'd like to have a little something", "image": "https://images.genius.com/053c70181ac1ec50a1116c1a9ad67aa4.953x953x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Crash Test Dummies"}
