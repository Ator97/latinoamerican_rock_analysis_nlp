You still owe me\nHow you askin' me for love? You don't know me\nShe not really bad, she just wear cosmetic\nReally bitches, niggas both on my aesthetic\nI dropped out of school, used to be athletic\nI pull up on pussy, I pull up protected\nNot my bih fuck her friends, savage and I'm reckless\nShe gon ride this dick like that bitch straight from Texas\n\n[Hook]\nNarrow it down\nEveryone around\nNo time for games\nNo time for clowns\nIt's way past twelve\nWe up right now\nIt feel like hell\nIt's lit right now\n\n{Verse 2]\nI just had a realization, inspiration\nAll designer garment for the decoration\nWatch the time tick tick no time to waste, no\nI cannot link up I cannot collaborate\nI cannot fuck with these rappers cause they start to copy-paste\nStarted out as friends but the love turned into hate\nI can't fuck with needy always asking for advice\nIf you want my time and advice you gon pay the price\nEvery time I talk I feel important\nEvery time you talk people ignore you\nSpaz all on the faces I recorded\nPlease don't ask me questions like reporters\n\n[Hook]\nNarrow it down\nEveryone around\nNo time for games\nNo time for clowns\nIt's way past twelve\nWe up right now\nIt feel like hell\nIt's lit right now\n\n[Outro]\nDrugs on drugs\nHoes on hoes\nFuck you need?\nAt this liquor store\nYeah-ooh, yeah-ooh\nAh-ooh, wa-ooh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/07323b37974e0f143a587eb384638f75.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Indica"}
