{"songs": [{"title": "Missing", "album": "Shine", "year": null, "lyrics": "Drawn to your face, like a moth to a flame\nSee it crystal clear, like a picture in a frame\nSo many wrongs, but I can only recall, recall the best of us, before we threw it all away\n\nI know I should forget, but I can't it let it go\n\nAnd even now, after all this time, I still wonder where you are\nAre you happy? Are you missing me at all?\nReaching out, 'cause I need to know, are you hurting like I am?\nAre you crying? Are you missing me at all?\n\nI know it's unkind to hope your heart's broken like mine\nBut it's the benefit for the one that's left behind\nI'm fixed to the floor, wondering whether to warn that any minute now, you'll come walking through the door\n\nI know I should forget, but I can't it let it go\n\nAnd even now, after all this time, I still wonder where you are\nAre you happy? Are you missing me at all?\nReaching out, 'cause I need to know, are you hurting like I am?\nAre you crying? Are you missing me at all?\n\nAah, aah, aah\nAah, aah, aah\n\nReaching out, 'cause I need to know, are you hurting like I am?\nAre you missing me at all?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/57fc316d0c7768d53cef5a998c38e0a9.600x600x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Indica"}
