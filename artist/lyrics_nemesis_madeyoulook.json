The way I flow, girl it get you tight ? Or is it loose ? I don't know just drank a bottle of Goose I'm the truth send in a army of troops I salute, you wanna have pen skills you gotta give up a tooth. When am I gon' get in the booth and show these other niggas to quit and find something else to do, everybody wanna rap, they better off smoking crack and its the same fuckin' sounds they bitin' thats why its trash, be creative I'm just saying you don't gotta take this advice, oh you different jump on the mic, & take us all on a flight, if someone bark you should bite, but if you sound the same long kiss goodnight\n\nThey shootin'. Ah made you look you couldn't flow even if you stole my rhyme book, them dimes coming the hoes coming, everybody acting fake yo they want something (x2)", "image": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1573677821"}], "artist": "Nemesis"}
