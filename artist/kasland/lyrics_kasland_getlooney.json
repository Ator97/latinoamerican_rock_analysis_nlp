Sleezy has a thing for the young ones\nLet\u2019s dance away the night, girl, it might go slow, it might go fast\nI like to watch you dance, girl, cause I really like your ass\nI take a wild guess why every girl calls me psychopath\nMaybe it\u2019s cause I like to wear lipstick on my Michael mask\nSo come on, girl, pucker up for Ms. Myers\nI don\u2019t diss rappers, baby girl, I diss liars\nThe ones who like to say that they\u2019re all about the music\nWhen they\u2019re all about the money and they\u2019re fake, I just lose it\nGuards in the asylum turn on a tight beat\nCause they know I start dancing and I can\u2019t control my feet\nI start to shake my booty and I start getting hot\nThat\u2019s how Mr. K. Sleezy ends up getting caught\n\n[Chorus]\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou can keep your pants on, Imma take my pants off\nWe don\u2019t have to dance long, we\u2019ll just have a dance off\nOnce you play the damn song, I can take my hands off\nMy butt cheeks and I let them clap \u2018til I can\u2019t cough\nI got some jiggy in my system and my butt won\u2019t stop\nGet on your knees, little slut, don\u2019t talk\nWhat the hell are you doing, get your hands off my zipper\nI just said get on your knees so I can feel bigger\nLook, security guards, while I\u2019m jamming on camera\nRocking out big like Hannah Montana\nFeeling like a pop star, flashy like a cop\u2019s car\nHealing crazy minds that rely on me like OnStar\nDamn, baby girl, I think I\u2019m starting to feel hungry\nGo pick me up some sushi and get it with your money\nI\u2019d get it myself, but there is no chance in\nHell that I can get myself to stop dancing\n\n[Chorus]\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\n\n[Verse 3]\nI crank that Soulja Boy while I try to sip pop\nPut the can up to my lips, but then a drip dropped\nEverybody always want to say shit talk\nI think Superman\u2019s here to save hip hop\nBut I could be wrong though, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time\nLike when I got yelled at for making up that nurse rhyme\nI think it kinda went a little something like this\nWhat? You thought I was actually gon\u2019 tell you\nGoing crazy in my cell, getting wild, and tearing sheets\nI\u2019ll kick you in the forehead while I\u2019m wearing cleats\nLeave you with a bruise the size of D. Prince\nI think I just made a fat joke, gee wiz\nKids look up to me like I belong on Nick Junior\nParents sick of Dora, I can make you sick sooner\nWant to see a magic trick? (Ok)\nI can make your kid disappear (no, wait)\n\n[Chorus]\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\n\n[Chorus]\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney\nThis beat right here makes me want to shake my booty\nJust get up and dance, I don\u2019t mean to sound fruity\nCome on, girl, don\u2019t act like a nooby\nStand up with me and let\u2019s get looney", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77efb51f2f4b1231f1aa95495419e885.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
