You decide, G\nIt seems these days, little underground rappers\nTry so hard to be just like me\nThey change their hair and the way they dress\nThis could be the beginning of what might be\nThe new generation of a problem from the year\n2000 and why it's hard to come by me\nSo will the real Kasland please stand up\nAs I stomp on all the fake ones I see\nIt's my uprising so hop on board\nOr be left behind, the choice is yours\nBeen screaming out my pain on this mic for years\nSo pardon me, y'all, if my voice is hoarse\nIf no one pays attention this time around\nThen Imma keep making noise, of course\nAnd if you don't like it then you can eat shit\nThen go commit Rolls Royce's doors\nBoys and whores, it's about that time\nTo show the whole damn world that I'm out my mind\nCall TMZ, introduce myself\nSay we're about to get to know each other now that I'm\nComing up in the game spitting so damn raw\nAll these people want to know is how did I find\nThe time to develop all of my skills\nThen turn it into something that could sound that fine\n\n[Chorus]\nI cover left, cover right\nA cause of stress, not one in sight\nI clench my fists, prepare to fight\nI'm coming in overnight and then I breach and clear\nBust these doors down I'm in, they don't want me near\nCause I'm coming for the win, and then I breach and clear\nFeel the changing of the wind, nothing left to fear\nJust a matter now of when, it's time to breach and clear\n\n[Verse 3]\nPass out at night, get wild, and wake up\nIn a strange place the following morning and discuss this\nBlackout problem that I'm having with my doc\nAfter last being seen, late, boarding a bus with\nA bunch of groupie girls trying to get with me\nBut y'all are all too damn boring to touch this\nSo back to my cell, flip my manager off\nAs I crawl in bed with Victoria Justice\nI do what I want, don't tuck my tail\nStay real and be me no matter what I sell\nIf I ever start slipping, end up in jail\nKeep some money on the side just to front my bail\nThis rap is all I know, give me one mic, nail\nThis track so ready up, Imma come by hail\nGave it all my focus and walked out of school\nScreaming I don't really give a flying fuck, I fail\n\n[Chorus]\nI cover left, cover right\nA cause of stress, not one in sight\nI clench my fists, prepare to fight\nI'm coming in overnight and then I breach and clear\nBust these doors down I'm in, they don't want me near\nCause I'm coming for the win, and then I breach and clear\nFeel the changing of the wind, nothing left to fear\nJust a matter now of when, it's time to breach and clear\n\n[Outro]\nDown I'm in\nFor the win\nOf the wind\nNow of when", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
