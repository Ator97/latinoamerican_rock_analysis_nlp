It's the sound of the clock ticking\nTime to let it out, Kas, I know you got a lot hidden\nOthers blowing up cause they're not giving up\nOn themselves, damn it, why can't you see that you're not living\nWhy am I afraid? I'm living a lie\nCan't seem to live, so I'm driven to die\nYou're too afraid to fail and I get that\nBut what do you think is going to happen if you don't give it a try\nTake a look around at all the things that you've won\nDo you want to let that go? That means that you're done\nYou put your heart in every song, but it bleeds out of none\nI hope that James shows up and he screams at you, son\nNow pick up your feet, walk like a man\nStraighten out those shoulders, you were taught how to stand\nYour favorite rapper rode the ride that you're on right now Difference is, when it stopped, he just hopped out and ran\nBut no, not you, you are stuck here in traffic\nYour future walks by, but you can't seem to grab it\nYou try to leave your past, but you're just like a magnet\nAnd keep on going back, then you're slacking, I've had it\nStop looking back, man, there ain't nothing there\nNot your friends, not your foes, just the pain that you dare\nTo feel everyday and you still want to pray\nThat a change will be made, but your brain's out of air\nThen you want to wonder why you never made it to admission And got to be a freshman, won't make it there wishing\nCan't seem to see that the point is what you're missing\nJust this one time, won't you shut up and listen\n\n[Chorus: Cryptic Wisdom]\nEverybody's got something on their mind\nThat they want to get accomplished all the time\nBut all I hear is talking, talking\nYou need to do a bit more walking, walking, mumbo jumbo\nEverybody's got something on their mind\nThat they want to get accomplished all the time\nBut all I hear is talking, talking\nYou need to do a bit more walking, walking, mumbo jumbo\n\n[Verse 2: Kasland]\nRemember years ago when you let your mind go\nThen you came up with something that would finally find gold\nYou never did a thing, that ship sailed through the seas\nThen you realized what you did and you fell to your knees\nYou missed another shot, now suck it up and stand\nThe problem here is that it was just another plan\nThat you never acted on just like everything else\nThat's why the only girl you loved went and fucked another man\nNow you have yourself a chance, but you can't seem to focus\nYour mind drifts off far away into the coldness\nYou can't fuck up again, but you already know this\nYou're wanting shit to change, then stop being hopeless\nNow, hear me out, you're stuck on these pills, feeling weary now\nScared of all the voices that you're hearing in your head\nWell now you're talking to yourself, so you can fear me now\nYou haven't made it yet, you're dreaming dude\nStop being what you're not, she's leaving you\nYou're giving up after all that we've been through\nMan, I know that you can do it, I believe in you\nI got to scream at you just to get your attention\nEven then you barely hear a thing that I mention\nYou're in your little world with your headphones blaring\nThat's the same kind of shit that kept your ass in detention\nEvery single year \u2019til you finally gave up\nSaid fuck an education, started trying to save up\nTo acquire you a studio and begin to chase your dreams\nBut what was there to say, man, your mind was made up\nRemember what you've learned, don't forget that it's sacred\nIt\u2019s time to lose your fear and stop standing there shaking\nYou don't know who I am, well I'm just going to say it\nI\u2019m the you of the future that never got to make it\n\n[Chorus: Cryptic Wisdom]\nEverybody's got something on their mind\nThat they want to get accomplished all the time\nBut all I hear is talking, talking\nYou need to do a bit more walking, walking, mumbo jumbo\nEverybody's got something on their mind\nThat they want to get accomplished all the time\nBut all I hear is talking, talking\nYou need to do a bit more walking, walking, mumbo jumbo", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
