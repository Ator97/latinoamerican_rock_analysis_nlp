Break that flow\nHaters get jealous and I hate that no-\n-Body ever wants to see others make that dough\nI can keep pushing forward, but I stay back though\nI ain't in it for the money cause I\u2019ve been broke, man\nTrying to get a 9 to 5 ever since '08\nSaid fuck it in '11, I'll just tie my shoes\nAnd take this ball and run it to the end zone, game\n\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\n\n[Verse 2]\nStarted off slow, now I'm racing to win\nDidn't mean to go crazy, but face it, I did\nI lost my mind, if I say this again\nI\u2019m afraid of what I'll do, man, I pray it's the end\nI'm chasing the wind in a dark night storm\nAnd I'm coming to see how far I've torn\nAway from myself and I'm blaming my health\nBut I'm the only one who killed the star I mourn\nNow I'm talking to myself and it kind of makes me\nSeem all insane, but it irritates me\nThat people have been judging me so much lately\nI feel like I'm alone and everybody hates me\nBut then there are those times that I feel God shows me signs\nThat everything will be ok, but then I feel like those are lies\nAnd I feel like I'm despised, no one wants me in their lives\nSo I look into the mirror and see the hatred in my eyes\nAnd that is how I look at the devil inside\nPeople want to know his name, it's irrelevant, I\nNever know what night I'll slip back in to the\nWait a minute, Kas, if you tell of it, die\nBut I'm selling it, right? Half y'all don't even know\nWhat the hell I'm talking about\nBuy a flashy car, start walking it out\nThen we'll see how much I'll be rocking a crowd\nPut some diamonds on my wrist, start rhyming all like this\nImma get my money while I'm wilding on a bitch\nIt seems that it works if you're looking to be heard\nBut I'm looking to eat, not looking to be served\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\n\n[Bridge]\n\u201cZiggy, face me you coward, I'm not afraid of you\u201d\n(Oh\u2026)\n\u201cYou took everything from me, you did this to me\u201d\n(Oh no, you did this to yourself) \u201cBullshit\u201d\n(I was more important to you than anyone you loved)\n\u201cI know what I have to do now\u201d\n(What, kill me?)\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d (No!)\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nBe here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\n\n[Outro]\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nGot your mind spinning like some carousels\nThis is how it all starts when a parent fails\nYou'll be here soon so prepare yourselves\nCause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells\nGot your mind spinning like some carousels\nThis is how it all starts when a parent fails", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
