Maybe she will listen now\nThe things I did were overlooked and love was all I needed\nSlowly, she began to form an attitude, became conceited\nEvery night we'd fuss and fight\nShe'd always take my heart and beat it\n\u2019Til she finally made it stop, she told me that she cheated\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nI used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl\nYou used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl\n\u2019Til you broke my heart and sent it to the underworld\nNow it's over, I'm moving on to another girl\nI used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl\nYou used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl\n\u2019Til you broke my heart and sent it to the underworld\nNow it's over, I'm moving on to another girl\n\n[Verse 2: Kasland]\nYou see, I thought I was in love with her, it took a while to notice\nThat she never was the one for me\nAnd now my heart feels homeless\nThe recovery's the slowest part of break ups, Cupid showed us\nLies and now I feel the coldest\nWe all need someone to hold us, right\nImma be a man about it\nSaw the heartbreak coming, but thought what if I just ran around it\nMan, there was no way I had to face it, couldn't stand the sound it\nMade up in my head, am I ok right now? Oh man, I doubt it\nHow could you just do this after everything we've been through\nSee, I tried to look away, but now it's every single issue\nPopping up, I can't keep up with it, you'd never think I'd miss you\nI was looking for true love and simply thought I'd seek it with you\nBut that shit nearly destroyed me, had me broken at my weakest\nThinking all the lies I ate were simply spoken out of sweetness\nAll my digging for the truth was just provoking all the meanness\nNow I'm showing how you made me feel\nAnd hoping that you'll see this\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nI used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl\nYou used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl\n\u2019Til you broke my heart and sent it to the underworld\nNow it's over, I'm moving on to another girl\nI used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl\nYou used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl\n\u2019Til you broke my heart and sent it to the underworld\nNow it's over, I'm moving on to another girl\n\n[Bridge]\n\"Hey, umm... It's me\nI was just thinking about you\nUmm... I miss you\nI wanted to see if we could talk sometime\nMaybe get a second chance\nI kind of miss how we used to be\nI want that again, like restart\nUmm... Give me a call sometime\nI love you... Bye\"\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nI used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl\nYou used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl\n\u2019Til you broke my heart and sent it to the underworld\nNow it's over, I'm moving on to another girl\nI used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl\nYou used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl\n\u2019Til you broke my heart and sent it to the underworld\nNow it's over, I'm moving on to another girl\n\n[Outro: Irv Da Phenom]\nSaid moving on, I\u2019m moving on\nI\u2019m moving on to another girl, another girl, yeah\nMoving on, I\u2019m moving on now\nMoving on to another girl", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
