Sleezy has feelings like me\nBut he was the first damn person to show it\nI got the little guy living inside my head\nWhat am I? I said, it\u2019s a curse and I know it\nBut I need him by my side to give me the strength\nAnd courage I need to verse my opponent\nAnd pop out, smack him around for a bit\n\u2019Til he\u2019s screaming cause it hurts when I doughnut\n\n\u201cWait, what about a doughnut? (A doughnut)\nDoughnut? (yeah, don\u2019t you like doughnuts?)\nNah (have you ever had a Hurtz doughnut?)\nWhat the hell\u2019s a Hurtz dou\u2026 *punch* (Hurts, don\u2019t it!?)\u201d\n\nI\u2019m here to stay for rounds to come\nSo you better pack a lunch, marine\nCause, boy, I\u2019m sick, I\u2019m the type to stick\nMy dick in a Pack-A-Punch machine\nGirl, I ain\u2019t playing with you, what\u2019s this look like\nCall Of Duty? God, you\u2019re fruity\nLook at you, you\u2019re all into me\nPull yourself together, hottie, ooh wee\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can\u2019t escape from this place so just stay right there\nWhen you\u2019re trying to fight these demons they don\u2019t fight fair\nI look right into the kiddy\u2019s eye like hi there\nWelcome to my asylum, it\u2019s a nightmare\n\n[Verse 3]\nSpeak to the devil then I sell my soul\nPedal to the metal then to hell I go\nThere\u2019s a fairytale in everybody\nLet me tell you the tale of a tale I know\nThis right here is the story of a man\nWho just doesn\u2019t know where the hell he\u2019s been\nOr where the hell he is, so tell me this\nCan you try to put your mind where your belly is\nTry having your thoughts shoved down your throat\nAll day long, you can tell he\u2019s pissed\nYou want my two cents on a record now\nHere\u2019s a penny for my thoughts, try selling this\nI give my thoughts to the mic\nAnd it looks back at me like what the hell is this\nI\u2019m a second away from pulling a gun\nAnd putting more holes in me than a deli Swiss\nLoad it, cock it, aim, don\u2019t stop it\nPoint to my head, say cheese, and shoot\nMen look at me like what the hell\nWomen look at me like he\u2019s a hoot\nWhat got me here is the one thing\nThat I cease to do, but it\u2019s pleasing you\nWant me to tell you my biggest secret\nWell that\u2019s too bad, cause I\u2019m teasing you\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can\u2019t escape from this place so just stay right there\nWhen you\u2019re trying to fight these demons they don\u2019t fight fair\nI look right into the kiddy\u2019s eye like hi there\nWelcome to my asylum, it\u2019s a nightmare", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77efb51f2f4b1231f1aa95495419e885.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
