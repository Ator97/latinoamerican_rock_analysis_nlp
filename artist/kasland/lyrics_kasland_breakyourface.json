I don't know, cause it rhymes\nAin't that what you say that my lyrics are random\nAnd you hate it when I spray 'em\nCause you fear it, can't stand them\nWhen you hear it, you phantom like a ghost, get gone\nWhen he starts to get fans that's when he knows it's on\nThe heat is on, pressure full blast\nThink you got what it takes in your mind to fool Kas\nDon't try to pull past or I'll pull your ass back\nLight a fucking black cat and shove it up your ass crack\nI'm a sicko, past that, you've got nothing to say\nWhere you going? Come back, quit walking away\nImma put you in your place like this is your place\nSo keep on talking and it's fist in your face\n\n[Chorus: Kasland & Lil Raheezy]\nSorry little homie, but I hate to say\nThis day today just ain't your day\nYou got a thing for hating and I hate your taste\nSo keep on talking and we'll break your face\nBreak your face, break your face\nGot the game tied up something like a shoe lace\nHating ass niggas, fall back, stay in your place\nCause you boys washed up, we'll break your face\n\n[Verse 2: Kasland]\nImma break your face, slam it with my fist\nIf you keep telling me you can't stand it when I diss\nAll these people when I'm pissed, but do you know why\nThen shut the fuck up, bitch, you can go die\nI originally planned for this album to be clean\nNo explicit content, but then I turned mean\nGot pissed off, ripped off a head or two\nBe happy that I killed a fucking fag instead of you\nI'm pissed off, who want it with me\nBring a goon with you, I'll bring a hundred with me\nPut your weapons down then we go all hands\nAbout to knock the fucking shit out these so-called fans\nPeople don't believe in me like he's going to fall\nAnnoyed by the fans when I'm seen in the mall\nThey think I won't snap while I scream at them all\nYet I'm dumb enough to brawl with Steven Seagal\n\n[Chorus: Kasland & Lil Raheezy]\nSorry little homie, but I hate to say\nThis day today just ain't your day\nYou got a thing for hating and I hate your taste\nSo keep on talking and we'll break your face\nBreak your face, break your face\nGot the game tied up something like a shoe lace\nHating ass niggas, fall back, stay in your place\nCause you boys washed up, we'll break your face\n\n[Verse 3: Lil Raheezy]\nWho fucking with me\nI spit that coke and my fans O.D\nI'll break your face, no I'm not friendly\nShow you red slime cause, with my nine, I'll make you bleed\nYeah, something like a cycle\nK's on deck, got nines, got rifles\nHalloween flow, I swear I'm bad like Michael\nAll my music riding something like motorcycles\nSo irrelevant, but I don't really give a fuck\nHating ass niggas mad cause they so washed up\nAlways strapped, got the nine tucked\nLike dodge ball, when I shoot, better duck\nOr just stay in your place\nCause I'm packing, homeboy, not talking about a suitcase\nGot the game tied up something like a shoelace\nSo keep running your mouth and watch us break your face\n\n[Chorus: Kasland & Lil Raheezy]\nSorry little homie, but I hate to say\nThis day today just ain't your day\nYou got a thing for hating and I hate your taste\nSo keep on talking and we'll break your face\nBreak your face, break your face\nGot the game tied up something like a shoe lace\nHating ass niggas, fall back, stay in your place\nCause you boys washed up, we'll break your face\n\n[Outro: Lil Raheezy]\nWe'll break your face\nWe'll break your face", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77efb51f2f4b1231f1aa95495419e885.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
