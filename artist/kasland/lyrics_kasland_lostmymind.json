Beezy shot him\nBut I think it's too late, damn Sleezy got him\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat should I do I think I lost my mind\nWait wait who are you I think I'm lost in time\nAll I know what to do is just to bust a rhyme\nAnd just go insane, cause I lost my mind\nWhat should I do I think I lost my mind\nWait wait who are you I think I'm lost in time\nAll I know what to do is just to bust a rhyme\nAnd just go insane, cause I lost my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nHanging in the alley with every face seen on a bill\nDrinking cold beer like we're on King of the Hill\nIt seems nowadays if you sing you got a deal\nRapper hunting, tell me what to bring and I will\nSome rope, machete, and dynamite too\nIt's a guarantee I'll shank you if I don't bite you\nAnd I don't like to use guns and explosives\nEvery rapper that sees us runs if he knows us\nGet used to me, I'm sick and I'm demented\n(I thought he was classy) nope, I just pretended\nI say the things I say for you to smile and I meant it\nTo the point that it would be offensive just to be offended\nMy rhymes are so splendid, man, they're fat like they're obese\nThey're gangsta, low tees, gold teeth, and goatees\nWith punchlines for homies, I bear arms like no sleeves\nYou say you want no beef with me, ho please\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat should I do I think I lost my mind\nWait wait who are you I think I'm lost in time\nAll I know what to do is just to bust a rhyme\nAnd just go insane, cause I lost my mind\nWhat should I do I think I lost my mind\nWait wait who are you I think I'm lost in time\nAll I know what to do is just to bust a rhyme\nAnd just go insane, cause I lost my mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nI found a prostitute and didn't pay her, but got busy\nShe accused me of rape, but I got charged for shoplifting\nThirty days later, her body's gone missing\nThe cops show up, I can feel my balls shifting\nExcuse me, sir, may I ask you a question\nDrop the machete or I'll have you arrested\nYou see this woman? Have you seen her lately\nSay, you look familiar, from the wanted list maybe\nOh shit they're onto me, what do I do now\nGet a fake mustache and hide out in a new town\nThat's the dude from the asylum, quick, get him\nStay away from me dude, I'm sick, venom\nAnd you don't want to see what happens when I spit\nMy mind goes crazy like some captain Jedi shit\nI bet you think I'm bluffing, don't you\nI think I saw something *scream* told you", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77efb51f2f4b1231f1aa95495419e885.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
