Come on\n\n[Chorus: Monica Humbles]\nThis is the way that things are and\nThis is the way we resolve them\nWe are the ones who make choices\nTo open up our eyes and utilize our voices\nThis is the way that things are and\nThis is the way we resolve them\nWe are the ones who make choices\nTo open up our eyes and utilize our voices\n\n[Bridge: Kasland]\nWe as human beings seem to overlook the screams\nSeem to overlook the things that connect us to our dreams\nAnd if really all it means to be united in the gleams\nOf this nation is to fear, then say what hope it really brings\nWe as human beings seem to overlook the screams\nSeem to overlook the things that connect us to our dreams\nAnd if really all it means to be united in the gleams\nOf this nation is to fear, then say what hope it really brings\n\n[Chorus: Kasland & Monica Humbles]\nThis is the way that things are and\nThis is the way we resolve them\nWe are the ones who make choices\nTo open up our eyes and utilize our voices\nThis is the way that things are and\nThis is the way we resolve them\nWe are the ones who make choices\nTo open up our eyes and utilize our voices", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
