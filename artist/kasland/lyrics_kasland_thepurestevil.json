I think I lost my mind\nWait, wait, where was I? Oh yeah, I lost my mind\nDo you turn in your sleep? Because I toss in mine\nEvery nightmare I have becomes an awesome rhyme\nI don't inspire kids to kill, so stop accusing me\nI'm the one who killed the person that I used to be\nHe was first and you're the sequel\nLadies and gentlemen, the purest evil\n\n[Chorus: Baby Bone & (Kasland)]\n(The purest evil) you can say what you want\nI don't care, I'm the truth\nIn my city, in the streets, or in the mother fucking booth\n(The purest evil) yeah, bitch, I'm bad\nOf course I'm pure evil\nI bet you everything that you do ain't legal\n(The purest evil) you ain't got to like it\nBut your girlfriend love it\nDo my thing in private, act an ass in public\n(The purest evil) give you three hands\nAnd you still couldn't touch it\n(The purest evil) and you still couldn't touch it\n\n[Verse 2: Baby Bone]\nI know you think I'm bad, but it's all good\nYeah I understand, but I'm never understood\nWhere I'm from, it's a long way from Hollywood\nBut my dream's still bigger than a Redwood\nThat's a big tree, I smoke big tree\nGet with Marty McFly, change history\nBefore my time, I don't even know why I'm here\nI go hard any date, you can pick a year\nTurn the cameras off, fuck the limelight\nEat these rappers up, now that's a soundbite\nMaybe not because I want to keep my appetite\nAnd I ain't saying I'm the best, but I'm alright\nAlright, nobody believes me\nWhen I disappear you want to act like you need me\nYou better watch how you treat me\nBeing good hard, being evil is easy\n\n[Chorus: Baby Bone & (Kasland)]\n(The purest evil) you can say what you want\nI don't care, I'm the truth\nIn my city, in the streets, or in the mother fucking booth\n(The purest evil) yeah, bitch, I'm bad\nOf course I'm pure evil\nI bet you everything that you do ain't legal\n(The purest evil) you ain't got to like it\nBut your girlfriend love it\nDo my thing in private, act an ass in public\n(The purest evil) give you three hands\nAnd you still couldn't touch it\n(The purest evil) and you still couldn't touch it\n\n[Verse 3: Kasland]\nTry not to be offended by the shit that I say\nLess mess will be made now that they're kissing my A\n-S-S if anything I'll be around 'til the day\nFeds fess that they're obsessed and won't get off of my case\nBest guess is that I'm wicked balling\nCured while the sick are falling\nIt's a problem, it's involving every single way\nThat I pissed them off and it's my fault, what else is there to say\nMan, I missed them all and hit the wall now all I do is pray\nDear heavenly father, please forgive me for my sins\nPlease forgive me for the items that I carry in my Benz\nI know it's probably too late for me to make amends\nI know my enemies lost, but in the end nobody wins\nAnd now I have no friends and I've come to realize\nThe shadows that I followed, they were not the real guys\nI walked into the darkness with no light and sealed eyes\nSo now, when I'm dead, on my tombstone, here lies\n\n[Chorus: Baby Bone & (Kasland)]\n(The purest evil) you can say what you want\nI don't care, I'm the truth\nIn my city, in the streets, or in the mother fucking booth\n(The purest evil) yeah, bitch, I'm bad\nOf course I'm pure evil\nI bet you everything that you do ain't legal\n(The purest evil) you ain't got to like it\nBut your girlfriend love it\nDo my thing in private, act an ass in public\n(The purest evil) give you three hands\nAnd you still couldn't touch it\n(The purest evil) and you still couldn't touch it", "image": "https://images.genius.com/77efb51f2f4b1231f1aa95495419e885.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
