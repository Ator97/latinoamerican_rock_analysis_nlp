Will he ever be sane? Who knows\n\n[Intro: Kasland]\nI feel like, like everybody hates me\nI lost everyone, and everything I've ever cared about\nIt seems like I'm stuck in the shadows\nAnd I don't know how to get out\nAnd I don't even know what I'm doing with this shit anymore\n\n[Verse 1: Kasland]\nStep back a minute Imma kill it, real shit\nLet the rhythm flow, don't conceal it, feel it\nStill that same rapper that nobody wants to deal with\nNever passed the torch down in my label, man, it's still lit\nSteal it? No one will ever get a chance to\nI tried to go on tour, but I just kept on getting canceled\nWould I ever sign a major deal? Depends who\nNot too many people like the crazy shit fans do\nDrawing my machete for the first time in years\nThis shit is getting heavy and it hurts lighter ears\nPeople can't take in the pain and that's the worst side of peers\nAnd I'm shanking all you bitches at the first sight of tears\nMan up, do you even know the shit I've been through\nA lonely life and broken heart and no one to attend to\nThe comfort that I needed, what the hell did I get into\nThe shits I used to give had me running to the men's room\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nTime to wake up, don't sleep on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nGot to get back to work, got to try to advance\nI said wake up, don't sleep on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nGot to get back on the saddle, this may be my last chance\n\n[Verse 2: Kasland]\nPeople hear about me, say they want to know my story, uh\nListen to my music, hear a tale about a warrior\nThere's been a lot of blood and it's about to get gorier\nStronger than before and back to fucking with Victoria\nDid you miss me? Well neither did I\nWhen I said that I could be a fucking leader, I lied\nCause I could blow at any second, I have a fever inside\nAnd I do the shit I do because I'm eager to die\nOh, wait, I'm sorry, I forgot, you don't like that\nWhat would make someone like me think to write that\nCame close a few times, but my demons seem to fight back\nCan't get away and they won't let me wave the white flag\nSo here I am once again, locked up, what's it been\nA couple years of hustling and no one makes a fuss of it\nMy heart is gone and mind is lost, my soul is what I must defend\nAnd see to it that in the end the devil in me doesn't win\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nTime to wake up, don't sleep on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nGot to get back to work, got to try to advance\nI said wake up, don't sleep on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nGot to get back on the saddle, this may be my last chance\n\n[Verse 3: Kasland]\n2K11, did an EP, thought I ripped it\nDidn't blow up, but the sales were terrific\n2K12, man, I said it would be different\nThen all I did was mess around and lose my best friend\n2K13, I'm mentally intact\nNow I bust my fucking ass to put my name on the map\n2K14, I'm telling y'all that\nY'all prepare yourselves for the wrath, real rap\nThink that this is what you're messing with? nah, hear the rest of it\nFirst time I did a thing without second guessing it\nPouring out my heart, telling stories, and confessing shit\nGoing through this hell has turned my ass into a pessimist\nLighten up Kas, things will get better\nJust pop another pill if you feel under the weather\nYour friends will forgive you, if they don't, let them go\nAfter all, you got me, your best friend, let them know\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nTime to wake up, don't sleep on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nGot to get back to work, got to try to advance\nI said wake up, don't sleep on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nDon't be sleeping on me now\nGot to get back on the saddle, this may be my last chance\n\n[Outro: Kasland]\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay\nAy, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (wake up)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
