I think this shit defines insanity\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nThen it goes right back\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nThen it goes right back\n\n[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]\nWhile you rappers was having periods\nI was just building pyramids\nThat shit you spit is gibberish, frivolous, I ain't hearing it\nStick a dick in your mouth, bitch, and go shove a beer in it\nFuck an exorcist, head spin around like a pirouette\nFuck y'all, lick taint, sick enough to lick paint\nSniff 'cane with Whitney and Rick James\nWhat you mean now, bitch, I ain't insane\nI ain't never signed with Tech, but I been strange\nBad-a-boom, bad-a-bang, got a room by the lake\nI'm tripping like fuck off the shrooms that I ate\nShe don't swallow cum so she stroke on my dick\nLet me spew it in her face\nYeah, Jesus Christ, I'm so fucking nice\nCrown me the illest rapper that have clutched the mic\nYour momma go buy me some gators if I fuck her right\nShe let me cut her all night and I ain't even touch a knife\nMy city's sleeping, got me pissed off and sick\nThese rappers couldn't hang if they was Rick Ross' tits\nI'll wipe a haters fucking lip gloss off my dick\nAnd I murder everything so you can just call it quits, bitch\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nThen it goes right back\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nThen it goes right back\n\n[Verse 3: Kasland]\nI offer all my mind and if you pass, then you'll miss out\nThey said to turn it up so now we're blasting it this loud\nI say we live it up cause it's the last day I'm in town\nPlus I'm rich now, can finally ask Taylor Swift out\nNah, I'm serious, will you date me Taylor\nUs together would be flyer than an aviator\nPlus, you're rich, could pay for dinner, and could save me paper\nThen can write your next song and you can thank me later\nI'm a dick and a half\nWhat can I say? I'm not afraid of people kicking my ass\nI'm moving on with my career while y'all just live in the past\nSo take another hot production and let me rip it in half, let's go\n\n[Chorus: Kasland]\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nThen it goes right back\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nAnd it goes like that\nThen it goes right back", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5c464cffeb15366c0cd47022c46818d9.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Kasland"}
