May day!\" she said to me\nHowever it's too late\nCaptain, oh Captain, we've lost our direction\n\nIt's too late\nIt's too late\nIt's too late\n\nIt's too late, it's too late\nI think the tide has come to wash you out\nWash you away from here\n(x2)", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e189e82befd163c28ae6b30574f6f203.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Audition"}
