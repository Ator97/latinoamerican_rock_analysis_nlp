I'm everything you want)\nAnd tell me what you see (you could pass a glance, you could pass a glance. I'm everything you want)\nA hole in my chest by the face in the reflection of me\n\nSlit slash I'm making a gash on your ego\nCause I'm far too good for you\nIs this the liquor talking?\nLights camera wait\nNo ones getting any action\nTake a sip while no ones looking\nJust to try to ease the tension\nDirector cut to my dying slowly\nOn the floor in the corner of a crowded room\n\nI'll ask you a question\n\nSharp and witty with my tongue\nNo need for hands with you\nI'll undress you with my eyes\n\nLook into my mirror (you could close the eyes, you could close the eyes. I'm everything you want)\nAnd tell me what you see (you could pass a glance, you could pass a glance. I'm everything you want)\nA hole in my chest by the face in the reflection of me\n\nYou will never be caught seen with me\nCause I'd be caught dead before I was seen with you\n\nBrace yourself and watch your back\nIt's time I bury this\nHatchet so deep inside your chest\nYou'll wish you never asked for it\nBrace yourself and watch your back\nIt's time I bury this\nHatchet so deep inside your chest\nYou'll wish you never asked for it\n\nWhen you tell me that everything was right\nWere you conscious of your subconscious on that night\n\nSo,look into my mirror (I'm everything you want and need)\nAnd tell me what you see (I'm everything you want and need)\nA hole in my chest by the face in the reflection of me\n\nAll I need is you on me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2b9290dc0f128856a44bfab735508228.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Audition"}
