What you go for?\nWhat is love for? I can't remember\nWhen you show up, then you leave us\nWhat is love for? I can't remember\n\nYou fill me up with such regret\nYou pack your shit\nThen you leave again, again, again, again, again\nWe waste all our time alone\n\nYou can say I'm not living in the world that you're living in\nYou can say anything you want to say about my friends\nBut they were there for me when you crushed me\nAnd I think it's best you just keep away\n\nWhat you go for? What you go for?\nWhat is love for? I can't remember\nWhen you show up, then you leave us\nWhat is love for? I can't remember\n\nYou fill me up with such regret\nYou pack your shit\nThen you leave again, again, again, again, again\nWe waste all our time alone\n\nWe waste all our time alone\nWe waste all our time alone\nWe waste all our time alone\n\nYou fill me up with such regret\nYou pack your shit\nThen you leave again\n\nWhat you go for? What you go for?\nWhat is love for? I can't remember\nWhen you show up, then you leave us\nWhat is love for? I can't remember\n\nYou fill me up with such regret\nYou pack your shit\nThen you leave again, again, again, again, again\nWe waste all our time alone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/f2502ec4a801404ff0961430343c29eb.300x300x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Audition"}
