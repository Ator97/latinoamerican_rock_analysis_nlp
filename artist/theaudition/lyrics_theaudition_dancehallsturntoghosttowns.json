'Cause I'm sick of dancin' alone\n\nWho is it tonight, Doctor Jekyll or Ms. Hyde?\n\nTwo hints lust, then I mix some charm with a dash of wits\nAdd some good looks and then, close the door and dim the lights\n(This will finally be the night)\nWhere the dictionary chemical cookbook will finally hook you into me\n\nWould you please take off your lab coat, kiss me as we roll through every chemical\nWould you please put on your dance shoes? 'Cause I'm sick of dancin' alone\n\nStolen everything you worked for\nLove was lost but better to remember\nLeft side, left side suicide\n\nPlease take off your lab coat and kiss me as we roll\nPlease put on your dance shoes and join me in this waltz\n\nWould you please take off your lab coat, kiss me as we roll through every chemical\nWould you please put on your dance shoes? 'Cause I'm sick of dancin' alone\n\nPlease take off your lab coat, kiss me as we roll\nPlease put on your dance shoes 'cause I'm sick of dancin' alone", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e189e82befd163c28ae6b30574f6f203.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Audition"}
