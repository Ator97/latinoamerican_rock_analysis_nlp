A night scare\nNothing to worry about\n\nChapter 3, the things that lawyers never tell\n\nChinese finger trap\nArms tied behind your back\nAnd you wish that we'd lend a hand\nBut that wasn't in the contract\nThis is your fascination, inflammable exaggeration\nSignature signed in blood, but it's artwork that we love\n\nI haven't slept in days\nThe devil's just like cocaine\nGradually constant and permanently pain\n\nStop and breathe\nIt was just an awful dream\nA nightmare. A night scare\nNothing to worry about\n\nWrap your hands around this pen\nI'll show you what it is to live\n(x4)\n\nStop and breathe\nIt was just an awful dream\nA nightmare. A night scare\nNothing to worry about\n\nStop and breathe\nIt was just an awful dream\nA nightmare. A night scare\nNothing to worry about", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e189e82befd163c28ae6b30574f6f203.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "The Audition"}
