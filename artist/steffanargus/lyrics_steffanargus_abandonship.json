[?]\nA pirate's life for me\nYo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-yo-yo, yo-ho, yo-ho\nYo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-yo-yo, yo-ho, yo-ho\n\nAll the runaways are running here today\nCowards and the brave are all looking to save\nWhat little pieces left of their imagination\n'cause the rest is adrift\nDeep inside the ocean\n\nAbandon everything you know\nSail with us and we'll show you\nWhat it means to be alive\nYo-oh-oh\nAll hands on deck\nStick out your neck\nFrom the sea. [?]\nA pirate's life for me\nYo-oh-oh\nYo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-yo-yo, yo-ho, yo-ho\nYo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-yo-yo, yo-ho, yo-ho\nYo-oh-oh\n\nYou can change the way you look\nTrade your hand in for a hook\nScratch your head and wonder why\nIt's always storming when you cry\nBut when that line of blood comes down\nIn some ways it reminds you how\nYou were before you got too old to leave\nAnd stories you were told\nBut all those fantasies are true:\nFairies, mermaids, pirates too\nBut all you're growing eyes can see\nDepends on how much you believe\nSo everything you thought you knew\nLike no one being there for you\nJust trust me that it isn't true\nThis our ship, and we're your crew\n(Abandon, abandon, abandon, abandon)\n\nAbandon everything you know\nSail with us and we'll show you\nWhat it means to be alive\nYo-oh-oh\nAll hands on deck\nStick out your neck\nFrom the sea. [?]\nA pirate's life for me\nYo-oh-oh\nYo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-yo-yo, yo-ho, yo-ho\nYo-oh-oh\nYo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-yo-yo, yo-ho, yo-ho\nYo-oh-oh\n\nThe best is yet to come\nThe treasure and the rum\nThe best is yet to come", "image": "https://images.genius.com/09b1bea410518947a0f211b508f965c3.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Steffan Argus"}
